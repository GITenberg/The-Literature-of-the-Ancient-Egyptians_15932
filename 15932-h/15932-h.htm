<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This little book is intended to serve as an elementary
introduction to the study of Egyptian Literature. Its
object is to present a short series of specimens of Egyptian
compositions, which represent all the great periods of
literary activity in Egypt under the Pharaohs, to all who are
interested in the study of the mental development of ancient
nations. It is not addressed to the Egyptological specialist,
to whom, as a matter of course, its contents are well known,
and therefore its pages are not loaded with elaborate notes
and copious references. It represents, I believe, the first
attempt made to place before the public a summary of the
principal contents of Egyptian Literature in a handy and
popular form.</p>

<p>The specimens of native Egyptian Literature printed
herein are taken from tombs, papyri, stel&aelig;, and other
monuments, and, with few exceptions, each specimen is complete
in itself. Translations of most of the texts have
appeared in learned works written by Egyptologists in
English, French, German, and Italian, but some appear in
English for the first time. In every case I have collated
my own translations with the texts, and, thanks to the
accurate editions of texts which have appeared in recent
years, it has been found possible to make many hitherto
difficult passages clear. The translations are as literal as
the difference between the Egyptian and English idioms
will permit, but it has been necessary to insert particles
and often to invert the order of the words in the original
works in order to produce a connected meaning in English.
The result of this has been in many cases to break up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_-7" id="Pg_-7" title="Pg_-7">[vi]</a></span> short abrupt sentences in which the Egyptian author delighted,
and which he used frequently with dramatic effect.
Extraordinarily concise phrases have been paraphrased, but
the meanings given to several unknown words often represent
guess-work.</p>

<p>In selecting the texts for translation in this book an
attempt has been made to include compositions that are
not only the best of their kind, but that also illustrate the
most important branches of Egyptian Literature. Among
these religious, mythological, and moral works bulk largely,
and in many respects these represent the peculiar bias of the
mind of the ancient Egyptian better than compositions of
a purely historical character. No man was more alive to
his own material interests, but no man has ever valued the
things of this world less in comparison with the salvation
of his soul and the preservation of his physical body. The
immediate result of this was a perpetual demand on his
part for information concerning the Other World, and for
guidance during his life in this world. The priests attempted
to satisfy his craving for information by composing the
Books of the Dead and the other funerary works with which
we are acquainted, and the popularity of these works seems
to show that they succeeded. From the earliest times the
Egyptians regarded a life of moral excellence upon earth
as a necessary introduction to the life which he hoped to
live with the blessed in heaven. And even in pyramid
times he conceived the idea of the existence of a God Who
judged rightly, and Who set "right in the place of wrong."
This fact accounts for the reverence in which he held the
Precepts of Ptah-hetep, Kaqemna, Herutataf, Amenemh&#257;t I,
Ani, Tuauf, Amen-hetep, and other sages. To him, as to
all Africans, the Other World was a very real thing, and
death and the Last Judgment were common subjects of
his daily thoughts. The great antiquity of this characteristic
of the Egyptian is proved by a passage in a Book of
Precepts, which was written by a king of the ninth or tenth
dynasty for his son, who reigned under the name of Merikar&#257;.
The royal writer in it reminds his son that the Chiefs [of Osiris]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_-6" id="Pg_-6" title="Pg_-6">[vii]</a></span>who judge sinners perform their duty with merciless justice
on the Day of Judgment. It is useless to assume that length
of years will be accepted by them as a plea of justification.
With them the lifetime of a man is only regarded as a
moment. After death these Chiefs must be faced, and the
only things that they will consider will be his works. Life
in the Other World is for ever, and only the reckless fool
forgets this fact. The man who has led a life free from lies
and deceit shall live after death like a god.</p>

<p>The reader who wishes to continue his studies of Egyptian
Literature will find abundant material in the list of works
given on <a href="#Pg_256">pp. 256-8.</a></p>

<h2>THE LITERATURE OF<br />
THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS</h2>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THOTH, THE AUTHOR OF EGYPTIAN LITERATURE.<br />
WRITING MATERIALS, ETC.<br /><br /></h3>


<p>The Literature of ancient Egypt is the product of a period
of about four thousand years, and it was written in three
kinds of writing, which are called hieroglyphic, hieratic, and
demotic. In the first of these the characters were pictures
of objects, in the second the forms of the characters were
made as simple as possible so that they might be written
quickly, and in the third many of them lost their picture
form altogether and became mere symbols. Egyptian
writing was believed to have been invented by the god
Tehuti, or Thoth, and as this god was thought to be a form
of the mind and intellect and wisdom of the God who created
the heavens and the earth, the picture characters, or hieroglyphs
as they are called, were held to be holy, or divine, or
sacred. Certain religious texts were thought to possess
special virtue when written in hieroglyphs, and the chapters
and sections of books that were considered to have been
composed by Thoth himself were believed to possess very
great power, and to be of the utmost benefit to the dead
when they were written out for them in hieroglyphs, and
buried with them in their coffins. Thoth also invented the
science of numbers, and as he fixed the courses of the sun,
moon, and stars, and ordered the seasons, he was thought
to be the first astronomer. He was the lord of wisdom,
and the possessor of all knowledge, both heavenly and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_2" id="Pg_2" title="Pg_2">[2]</a></span>earthly, divine and human; and he was the author of every
attempt made by man to draw, paint, and carve. As the
lord and maker of books, and as the skilled scribe, he was
the clerk of the gods, and kept the registers wherein the
deeds of men were written down. The deep knowledge of
Thoth enabled him to find out the truth at all times, and
this ability caused the Egyptians to assign to him the position
of Chief Judge of the dead. A very ancient legend
states that Thoth acted in this capacity in the great trial
that took place in heaven when Osiris was accused of certain
crimes by his twin-brother Set, the god of evil. Thoth
examined the evidence, and proved to the gods that the
charges made by Set were untrue, and that Osiris had
spoken the truth and that Set was a liar. For this reason
every Egyptian prayed that Thoth might act for him as
he did for Osiris, and that on the day of the Great Judgment
Thoth might preside over the weighing of his heart
in the Balance. All the important religious works in all
periods were believed to have been composed either by
himself, or by holy scribes who were inspired by him. They
were believed to be sources of the deepest wisdom, the like
of which existed in no other books in the world. And it is
probably to these books that Egypt owed her fame for learning
and wisdom, which spread throughout all the civilised
world. The "Books of Thoth," which late popular tradition
in Egypt declared to be as many as 36,525 in number,
were revered by both natives and foreigners in a way which
it is difficult for us in these days to realise. The scribes who
studied and copied these books were also specially honoured,
for it was believed that the spirit of Thoth, the twice-great
and thrice-great god, dwelt in them. The profession of the
scribe was considered to be most honourable, and its rewards
were great, for no rank and no dignity were too high for the
educated scribe. Thoth appears in the papyri and on the
monuments as an ibis-headed man, and his companion is
usually a dog-headed ape called "Asten." In the Hall of
the Great Judgment he is seen holding in one hand a reed
with which he is writing on a palette the result of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_3" id="Pg_3" title="Pg_3">[3]</a></span>weighing of the heart of the dead man in the Balance. The
gods accepted the report of Thoth without question, and
rewarded the good soul and punished the bad according to
his statement.</p>

<p>From the beginning to the end of the history
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_4" id="Pg_4" title="Pg_4">[4]</a></span>of Egypt the position of Thoth as the "righteous judge,"
and framer of the laws by which heaven and earth, and
men and gods were governed, remained unchanged.</p>

<p>The substances used by the Egyptians for writing upon
were very numerous, but the commonest were stone of
various kinds, wood, skin, and papyrus. The earliest writings
were probably traced upon these substances with some
fluid, coloured black or red, which served as ink. When
the Egyptians became acquainted with the use of the metals
they began to cut their writings in stone. The text of one
of the oldest chapters of the Book of the Dead (LXIV) is
said in the Rubric to the chapter to have been "found"
cut upon a block of "alabaster of the south" during the
reign of Menkaur&#257;, a king of the fourth dynasty, about
3700 B.C. As time went on and men wanted to write long
texts or inscriptions, they made great use of wood as a
writing material, partly on account of the labour and expense
of cutting in stone. In the British Museum many wooden
coffins may be seen with their insides covered with religious
texts, which were written with ink as on paper. Sheepskin,
or goatskin, was used as a writing material, but its use was
never general; ancient Egyptian documents written on skin
or, as we should say, on parchment, are very few. At a
very early period the Egyptians learned how to make a sort
of paper, which is now universally known by the name of
"papyrus." When they made this discovery cannot be
said, but the hieroglyphic inscriptions of the early dynasties
contain the picture of a roll of papyrus, and the antiquity
of the use of papyrus must therefore be very great. Among
the oldest dated examples of inscribed papyrus may be
noted some accounts which were written in the reign of King
Assa (fourth dynasty, 3400 B.C.), and which were found at
Sakk&#257;rah, about 20 miles to the south of Cairo.</p>

<p>Papyrus was made from the papyrus plant that grew and
flourished in the swamps and marshes of Lower Egypt,
and in the shallow pools that were formed by the annual
Nile flood. It no longer grows in Egypt, but it is found in
the swamps of the Egyptian S&#363;d&#257;n, where it grows sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_5" id="Pg_5" title="Pg_5">[5]</a></span>to a height of 25 feet. The roots and the stem, which
is often thicker than a man's arm, are used as fuel, and the
head, which is large and rounded, is in some districts boiled
and eaten as a vegetable. The Egyptian variety of the
papyrus plant was smaller than that found in the S&#363;d&#257;n,
and the Egyptians made their paper from it by cutting the
inner part of the stem into thin strips, the width of which
depended upon the thickness of the stem; the length of these
varied, of course, with the length of the stem.</p>

<p>To make a sheet of papyrus several of these strips were laid side by
side lengthwise, and several others were laid over them
crosswise. Thus each sheet of papyrus contained two layers,
which were joined together by means of glue and water or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_6" id="Pg_6" title="Pg_6">[6]</a></span>gum. Pliny, a Roman writer, states (Bohn's edition, vol. iii.
p. 189) that Nile water, which, when in a muddy state, has
the peculiar qualities of glue, was used in fastening the two
layers of strips together, but traces of gum have actually
been found on papyri. The sheets were next pressed and
then dried in the sun, and when rubbed with a hard polisher
in order to remove roughnesses, were ready for use.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> By
adding sheet to sheet, rolls of papyrus of almost any length
could be made. The longest roll in the British Museum is
133 feet long by 16&frac12; inches high (Harris Papyrus, No. 1),
and the second in length is a copy of the Book of the Dead,
which is 123 feet long and 18&frac12; inches high; the latter contains
2666 lines of writing arranged in 172 columns. The
rolls on which ordinary compositions were written were
much shorter and not so high, for they are rarely more
than 20 feet long, and are only from 8 to 10 inches in
height.</p>

<p>The scribe mixed on his palette the paints which he used.
This palette usually consisted of a piece of alabaster, wood,
ivory, or slate, from 8 to 16 inches in length and from 2 to 3&frac12;
inches in width; all four corners were square. At one end
of the palette a number of oval or circular hollows were
sunk to hold ink or paint. Down the middle was cut a
groove, square at one end and sloping at the other, in which
the writing reeds were placed. These were kept in position
by a piece of wood glued across the middle of the palette,
or by a sliding cover, which also served to protect the reeds
from injury. On the sides of this groove are often found
inscriptions that give the name of the owner of the palette,
and that contain prayers to the gods for funerary offerings,
or invocations to Thoth, the inventor of the art of writing.
The black ink used by the scribes was made of lamp-black
or of finely-powdered charcoal mixed with water, to which
a very small quantity of gum was probably added. Red
and yellow paint were made from mineral earths or ochres,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_7" id="Pg_7" title="Pg_7">[7]</a></span>blue paint was made from lapis-lazuli powder, green paint
from sulphate of copper, and white paint from lime-white.
Sometimes the ink was placed in small wide-mouthed pots
made of Egyptian porcelain or alabaster. The scribe rubbed
down his colours on a stone slab with a small stone muller.
The writing reed, which served as a pen, was from 8 to 10
inches long, and from one-sixteenth to one-eighth of an inch
in diameter; the end used in writing was bruised and not
cut. In late times a very much thicker reed was used, and
then the end was cut like a quill or steel pen. Writing reeds
of this kind were carried in boxes of wood and metal specially
made for the purpose. Many specimens of all kinds of
Egyptian writing materials are to be seen in the Egyptian
Rooms of the British Museum.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In some parts of Mesopotamia where scribes at the present day use rough
paper made in Russia, each sheet before being written upon is laid upon a
board and polished by means of a glass bottle.</p></div>

<p>As papyrus was expensive the pupils in the schools attached
to the great temples of Egypt wrote their exercises
and copies of standard literary compositions on slices of white
limestone of fine texture, or upon boards, in the shape of
modern slates used in schools, whitened with lime. The
"copies" from which they worked were written by the
teacher on limestone slabs of somewhat larger size. Copies
of the texts that masons cut upon the walls of temples and
other monuments were also written on slabs of this kind,
and when figures of kings or gods were to be sculptured on the
walls their proportions were indicated by perpendicular and
horizontal lines drawn to scale. Portions of broken earthen-ware
pots were also used for practising writing upon, and
in the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods lists of goods, and
business letters, and the receipts given by the tax-gatherers,
were written upon potsherds. In still later times, when
skin or parchment was as expensive as papyrus, the Copts,
or Egyptian Christians, used slices of limestone and potsherds
for drafts of portions of the Scriptures and letters in
much the same way as did their ancestors.</p>

<p>A roll of papyrus when not in use was kept in shape by
a string or piece of papyrus cord, which was tied in a bow;
sometimes, especially in the case of legal documents, a clay
seal bearing the owner's name was stamped on the cord.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_8" id="Pg_8" title="Pg_8">[8]</a></span>Valuable rolls were kept in wooden cases or "book boxes,"
which were deposited in a chamber or "house" set apart
for the purpose, which was commonly called the "house of
books," <i>i.e.</i> the library. Having now described the principal
writing materials used by the ancient Egyptians, we
may pass on to consider briefly the various classes of
Egyptian Literature that have come down to us.<br /></p>

<h3>THE PYRAMID TEXTS<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"Pyramid Texts" is the name now commonly given to the
long hieroglyphic inscriptions that are cut upon the walls of
the chambers and corridors of five pyramids at Sakk&#257;rah.
The oldest of them was built for Unas, a king of the fifth
dynasty, and the four others were built for Teta, Pepi I,
Merenr&#257;, and Pepi II, kings of the sixth dynasty. According
to the calculation of Dr. Brugsch, they were all built
between 3300 and 3150 B.C., but more recent theories assign
them to a period about 700 years later. These Texts represent
the oldest religious literature known to us, for they
contain beliefs, dogmas, and ideas that must be thousands
of years older than the period of the sixth dynasty when
the bulk of them was drafted for the use of the masons who
cut them inside the pyramids. It is probable that certain
sections of them were composed by the priests for the
benefit of the dead in very primitive times in Egypt, when
the art of writing was unknown, and that they were repeated
each time a king died. They were first learned by heart
by the funerary priests, and then handed on from mouth
to mouth, generation after generation, and at length after
the Egyptians had learned to write, and there was danger
of their being forgotten, they were committed to writing.
And just as these certain sections were absorbed into the
great body of Pyramid Texts of the sixth dynasty, so
portions of the Texts of the sixth dynasty were incorporated
into the great Theban Book of the Dead, and they
appear in papyri that were written more than 2000 years
later. The Pyramid Texts supply us with much information
concerning the religious beliefs of the primitive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_10" id="Pg_10" title="Pg_10">[10]</a></span>Egyptians, and also with many isolated facts of history
that are to be found nowhere else, but of the meaning of
a very large number of passages we must always remain
ignorant, because they describe states of civilisation, and
conditions of life and climate, of which no modern person
can form any true conception. Besides this the meanings
of many words are unknown, the spelling is strange and often
inexplicable, the construction of the sentence is frequently
unlike anything known in later texts, and the ideas that
they express are wholly foreign to the minds of students
of to-day, who are in every way aliens to the primitive
Egyptian African whose beliefs these words represent. The
pyramids at Sakk&#257;rah in which the Pyramid Texts are
found were discovered by the Frenchman, Mariette, in 1880.
Paper casts of the inscriptions, which are deeply cut in the
walls and painted green, were made for Professor Maspero,
the Director of the Service of Antiquities in Egypt, and
from these he printed an edition in hieroglyphic type of
all five texts, and added a French translation of the greater
part of them. Professor Maspero correctly recognised the
true character of these old-world documents, and his translation
displayed an unrivalled insight into the true meaning
of many sections of them. The discovery and study of
other texts and the labours of recent workers have cleared
up passages that offered difficulties to him, but his work
will remain for a very long time the base of all investigations.</p>

<p>The Pyramid Texts, and the older texts quoted or embodied in
them, were written, like every religious funerary
work in Egypt, for the benefit of the king, that is to say,
to effect his glorious resurrection and to secure for him happiness
in the Other World, and life everlasting. They were
intended to make him become a king in the Other World
as he had been a king upon earth; in other words, he was
to reign over the gods, and to have control of all the powers
of heaven, and to have the power to command the spirits
and souls of the righteous, as his ancestors the kings of
Egypt had ruled their bodies when they lived on earth.
The Egyptians found that their king, who was an incarnation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_11" id="Pg_11" title="Pg_11">[11]</a></span>of the "Great God," died like other men, and they
feared that, even if they succeeded in effecting his resurrection
by means of the Pyramid Texts, he might die a second
time in the Other World. They spared no effort and left
no means untried to make him not only a "living soul"
in the Tuat, or Other World, but to keep him alive there.
The object of every prayer, every spell, every hymn, and
every incantation contained in these Texts, was to preserve
the king's life. This might be done in many ways.
In the first place it was necessary to provide a daily supply
of offerings, which were offered up in the funerary temple
that was attached to every pyramid. The carefully selected
and duly appointed priest offered these one by one, and as
he presented each to the spirit of the king he uttered a
formula that was believed to convert the material food into
a substance possessing a spiritual character and fit to form
the food of the <i>ka</i>, or "double," or "vital power," of the
dead king. The offerings assisted in renewing his life, and
any failure to perform this service was counted a sin against
the dead king's spirit. It was also necessary to perform
another set of ceremonies, the object of which was to "open
the mouth" of the dead king, <i>i.e.</i> to restore to him the
power to breathe, think, speak, taste, smell, and walk. At
the performance of these ceremonies it was all-important
to present articles of food, wearing apparel, scents and
unguents, and, in short, every object that the king was
likely to require in the Other World. The spirits of all
these objects passed into the Other World ready for use by
the spirit of the king. It follows as a matter of course that
the king in the Other World needed a retinue, and a bodyguard,
and a host of servants, just as he needed slaves upon
earth. In primitive times a large number of slaves, both
male and female, were slain when a king died, and their
bodies were buried in his tomb, whilst their spirits passed
into the Other World to serve the spirit of the king, just as
their bodies had served his body upon earth. As the king
had enemies in this world, so it was thought he would have
enemies in the Other World, and men feared that he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_12" id="Pg_12" title="Pg_12">[12]</a></span>be attacked or molested by evilly-disposed gods and spirits,
and by deadly animals and serpents, and other noxious
reptiles. To ward off the attacks of these from his tomb,
and his mummified body, and his spirit, the priest composed
spells of various kinds, and the utterance of such, in a
proper manner, was believed to render him immune from
the attacks of foes of all kinds. Very often such spells took
the form of prayers. Many of the spells were exceedingly
ancient, even in the Pyramid Period; they were, in fact, so
old that they were unintelligible to the scribes of the day.
They date from the time when the Egyptians believed more
in magic than religion; it is possible that when they were
composed, religion, in our sense of the word, was still undeveloped
among the Egyptians.</p>

<p>When the Pyramid Texts were written men believed that
the welfare of souls and spirits in the Other World could be
secured by the prayers of the living. Hence we find in
them numerous prayers for the dead, and hymns addressed
to the gods on their behalf, and extracts from many kinds
of ancient religious books. When these were recited, and
offerings made both to the gods and to the dead, it was
confidently believed that the souls of the dead received
special consideration and help from the gods, and from all
the good spirits who formed their train. These prayers are
very important from many points of view, but specially so
from the fact that they prove that the Egyptians who lived
under the sixth dynasty attached more importance to them
than to magical spells and incantations. In other words,
the Egyptians had begun to reject their belief in the efficacy
of magic, and to develop a belief of a more spiritual character.
There were many reasons for this development, but the
most important was the extraordinary growth of the influence
of the religion of Osiris, which had before the close of
the period of the sixth dynasty spread all over Egypt. This
religion promised to all who followed it, high or low, rich
or poor, a life in the world beyond the grave, after a resurrection
that was made certain to them through the sufferings,
death, and resurrection of Osiris, who was the incarnation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_13" id="Pg_13" title="Pg_13">[13]</a></span>of the great primeval god who created the heavens and the
earth. A few extracts illustrating the general contents of
the Pyramid Texts may now be given.<br /><br /></p>

<p><b>I.</b> Mention has already been made of the "opening of the
mouth" of the dead king: under the earliest dynasties
this ceremony was performed on a statue of the king. Water
was sprinkled before it, and incense was burnt, and the
statue was anointed with seven kinds of unguents, and its
eyes smeared with eye paint. After the statue had been
washed and dressed a meal of sepulchral offerings was set
before it. The essential ceremony consisted in applying to
the lips of the statue a curiously shaped instrument called
the <span class="smcap">Pesh Kef</span>, with which the bandages that covered the
mouth of the dead king in his tomb were supposed to be cut
and the mouth set free to open. In later times the Liturgy
of Opening the Mouth was greatly enlarged and was called
the Book of Opening the Mouth. The ceremonies were
performed by the Kher-heb priest, the son of the deceased,
and the priests and ministrants called Sameref, Sem, Smer,
Am-as, Am-khent, and the assistants called Mesentiu. First
of all incense was burnt, and the priest said, "Thou art
pure," four times. Water was then sprinkled over the
statue and the priest said, "Thou art pure. Thou art pure.
Thy purifications are the purifications of Horus,<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and the
purifications of Horus are thy purifications." This formula
was repeated three times, once with the name of Set,<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> once
with the name of Thoth,<a name="FNanchor_3_4" id="FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and once with the name of Sep.
The priest then said, "Thou hast received thy head, and
thy bones have been brought unto thee before Keb."<a name="FNanchor_4_5" id="FNanchor_4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
During the performance of the next five ceremonies, in
which incense of various kinds was offered, the priest said:
"Thou art pure (four times). That which is in the two eyes
of Horus hath been presented unto thee with the two vases
of Thoth, and they purify thee so that there may not exist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_14" id="Pg_14" title="Pg_14">[14]</a></span>in thee the power of destruction that belongeth unto thee.
Thou art pure. Thou art pure. Pure is the <i>seman</i> incense
that openeth thy mouth. Taste the taste thereof in the
divine dwelling. <i>Seman</i> incense is the emission of Horus;
it stablisheth the heart of Horus-Set, it purifieth the gods
who are in the following of Horus. Thou art censed with
natron. Thou art established among the gods thy brethren.
Thy mouth is like that of a sucking calf on the day of its
birth. Thou art censed. Thou art censed. Thou art pure.
Thou art pure. Thou art established among thy brethren
the gods. Thy head is censed. Thy mouth is censed.
Thy bones are purified. [Decay] that is inherent in thee
shall not touch thee. I have given thee the Eye of Horus,<a name="FNanchor_5_6" id="FNanchor_5_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_6" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
and thy face is filled therewith. Thou art shrouded in
incense (say twice)."<a name="FNanchor_6_7" id="FNanchor_6_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_7" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The next ceremony, the ninth, represented the re-birth
of the king, who was personified by a priest. The priest,
wrapped in the skin of a bull, lay on a small bed and feigned
death. When the chief priest had said, "O my father," four
times, the priest representing the king came forth from the
bull's skin, and sat up; this act symbolized the resurrection
of the king in the form of a spirit-body (<i>s&#257;hu</i>). The chief
priest then asserted that the king was alive, and that he
should never be removed, and that he was similar in every
way to Horus. The priest personifying the king then put
on a special garment, and taking a staff or sceptre in his
hand, said, "I love my father and his transformation. I
have made my father, I have made a statue of him, a large
statue. Horus loveth those who love him." He then
pressed the lips of the statue, and said, "I have come to
embrace thee. I am thy son. I am Horus. I have pressed
for thee thy mouth.... I am thy beloved son." The words
then said by the chief priest, "I have delivered this mine eye
from his mouth, I have cut off his leg," mean that the king
was delivered from the jaws of death, and that a grievous
wound had been inflicted on the god of death, <i>i.e.</i> Set.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_15" id="Pg_15" title="Pg_15">[15]</a></span>Whilst these ceremonies were being performed the animals
brought to be sacrificed were slain. Chief of these were
two bulls, gazelle, geese, &amp;c., and their slaughter typified
the conquest and death of the enemies of the dead king.
The heart and a fore-leg of each bull were presented to the
statue of the king, and the priest said: "Hail, Osiris! I
have come to embrace thee. I am Horus. I have pressed
for thee thy mouth. I am thy beloved Son. I have opened
thy mouth. Thy mouth hath been made firm. I have
made thy mouth and thy teeth to be in their proper places.
Hail, Osiris!<a name="FNanchor_1_8" id="FNanchor_1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_8" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> I have opened thy mouth with the Eye of
Horus." Then taking two instruments made of metal the
priest went through the motion of cutting open the mouth
and eyes of the statue, and said: "I have opened thy
mouth. I have opened thy two eyes. I have opened thy
mouth with the instrument of Anpu.<a name="FNanchor_2_9" id="FNanchor_2_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_9" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> I have opened thy
mouth with the Meskha instrument wherewith the mouth
of the gods was opened. Horus openeth the mouth and eyes
of the Osiris. Horus openeth the mouth of the Osiris even
as he opened the mouth of his father. As he opened the
mouth of the god Osiris so shall he open the mouth of my
father with the iron that cometh forth from Set, with the
Meskha instrument of iron wherewith he opened the mouth
of the gods shall the mouth of the Osiris be opened. And
the Osiris shall walk and shall talk, and his body shall be
with the Great Company of the Gods who dwell in the Great
House of the Aged One (<i>i.e.</i> the Sun-god) who dwelleth in
Anu.<a name="FNanchor_3_10" id="FNanchor_3_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_10" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> And he shall take possession of the Urrt Crown
therein before Horus, the Lord of mankind. Hail, Osiris!
Horus hath opened thy mouth and thine eyes with the
instruments Sebur and An, wherewith the mouths of the
gods of the South were opened.... All the gods bring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_16" id="Pg_16" title="Pg_16">[16]</a></span>words of power. They recite them for thee. They make
thee to live by them. Thou becomest the possessor of twofold
strength. Thou makest the passes that give thee the
fluid of life, and their life fluid is about thee. Thou art
protected, and thou shalt not die. Thou shalt change thy
form [at pleasure] among the Doubles<a name="FNanchor_4_11" id="FNanchor_4_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_11" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of the gods. Thou
shalt rise up as a king of the South. Thou shalt rise up as
a king of the North. Thou art endowed with strength like
all the gods and their Doubles. Shu<a name="FNanchor_5_12" id="FNanchor_5_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_12" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> hath equipped thee.
He hath exalted thee to the height of heaven. He hath
made thee to be a wonder. He hath endowed thee with
strength."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_8" id="Footnote_1_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_8"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> It was assumed that the king after death became a being with the nature
of Osiris, and he was therefore addressed as "Osiris."</p></div>

<p>The ceremonies that followed concerned the dressing of
the statue of the king and his food. Various kinds of
bandlets and a collar were presented, and the gift of each
endowed the king in the Other World with special qualities.
The words recited by the priest as he offered these and
other gifts were highly symbolic, and were believed to
possess great power, for they brought the Double of the
king back to this earth to live in the statue, and each time
they were repeated they renewed the life of the king in the
Other World.<br /><br /></p>


<p><b>II.</b> The <i>Liturgy of Funerary Offerings</i> was another all-important
work. The oldest form of it, which is found in
the Pyramid Texts, proves that even under the earliest
dynasties the belief in the efficacy of sacrifices and offerings
was an essential of the Egyptian religion. The opening
ceremonies had for their object the purification of the
deceased by means of sprinkling with water in which salt,
natron, and other cleansing substances had been dissolved,
and burning of incense. Then followed the presentation
of about one hundred and fifty offerings of food of all kinds,
fruit, flowers, vegetables, various kinds of wine, seven kinds
of precious ointments, wearing apparel of the kind suitable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_17" id="Pg_17" title="Pg_17">[17]</a></span>for a king, &amp;c. As each object was presented to the spirit
of the king, which was present in his statue in the Tuat
Chamber of the tomb, the priest recited a form of words,
which had the effect of transmuting the substance of the
object into something which, when used or absorbed by the
king's spirit, renewed the king's life and maintained his
existence in the Other World. Every object was called
the "Eye of Horus," in allusion to its life-giving qualities.
The following extracts illustrate the Liturgy of Funerary
Offerings:</p>

<p>32. This libation is for thee, Osiris, this libation is for
thee, Unas.<a name="FNanchor_1_13" id="FNanchor_1_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_13" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (<i>Here offer cold water of the North</i>.) It cometh
forth before thy son, cometh forth before Horus. I have
come, I have brought unto thee the Eye of Horus, that thy
heart may be refreshed thereby. I have brought it and
have set it under thy sandals, and I present unto thee that
which flowed forth from thee. There shall be no stoppage
to thy heart whilst it is with thee, and the offerings that
appear at the command<a name="FNanchor_2_14" id="FNanchor_2_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_14" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> shall appear at thy word of command.
(<i>Recite four times.</i>)</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_13" id="Footnote_1_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_13"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The king who is identified with Osiris.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_14" id="Footnote_2_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_14"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The deceased who possessed the words of power uttered in the tomb
the names of the offerings he required, and the offerings appeared forthwith.</p></div>

<p>37. Thou hast taken possession of the two Eyes of Horus,
the White and the Black, and when they are in thy face
they illumine it. (<i>Here offer two jugs of wine, one white,
one black.</i>)</p>

<p>38. Day hath made an offering unto thee in the sky. The
South and the North have given offerings unto thee. Night
hath made an offering unto thee. The South and the North
have made an offering unto thee. An offering is brought
unto thee, look upon it; an offering, hear it. There
is an offering before thee, there is an offering behind thee,
there is an offering with thee. (<i>Here offer a cake for the
journey.</i>)</p>

<p>41. Osiris Unas, the white teeth of Horus are presented
unto thee so that they may fill thy mouth. (<i>Here offer five
bunches of onions.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_18" id="Pg_18" title="Pg_18">[18]</a></span>47. O R&#257;, the worship that is paid to thee, the worship of
every kind, shall be paid [also] to Unas. Everything that
is offered to thy body shall be offered to the Double of Unas
also, and everything that is offered to his body shall be
thine. (<i>Here offer the table of holy offerings.</i>)</p>

<p>61. O ye oils, ye oils, which are on the forehead of Horus,
set ye yourselves on the forehead of Unas, and make him
to smell sweet through you. (<i>Here offer oil of cedar of the
finest quality.</i>)</p>

<p>62. Make ye him to be a spirit-soul (<i>khu</i>) through possession
of you, and grant ye him to have the mastery over
his body, let his eyes be opened, and let all the spirit-souls
see him, and let them hear his name. Behold, Osiris Unas,
the Eye of Horus hath been brought unto thee, for it hath
been seized for thee that it may be before thee. (<i>Here offer
the finest Thehenu oil.</i>)<br /><br /></p>


<p><b>III.</b> As specimens of the hymns in the Pyramid Texts
may be quoted the following: the first is a hymn to Nut,
the Sky-goddess, and the second is a hymn to R&#257;, the
Sun-god.</p>

<p>

Assuredly they shall not cease from thee like the stars.<br />
Let not this Pepi depart from thee in thy name of "Hert" (ll. 61-64).<br />

<p>The Hymn to the Sun-god is as follows:</p>

<p>
Hail to thee, Tem! Hail to thee, Kheprer, who created himself.<br />
Thou art the High, in this thy name of "Height."<br />
Thou camest into being in this thy name of "Kheprer."<br />

Thou takest them to him in every place wherein it pleaseth him to be.<br />
The doors upon thee stand fast [shut] like the god Anmutef,<a name="FNanchor_2_16" id="FNanchor_2_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_16" class="fnanchor">[2]</a><br />

They open not to those who are in the South;<br />
They open not to those who are in the middle of the earth;<br />
But they open to Horus.<br />

<p>He it was who made them, he it was who made them stand [firm],
he it was who delivered them from every evil attack which the god
Set made upon them. He it was who made thee to be a settled
country in this thy name of "Kerkut." He it was who passed
bowing after thee in thy name of "Nut." He it was who delivered
thee from every evil attack which Set made upon thee

<p><b>IV.</b> The following passages describe the power of the king
in heaven, and his felicity there:</p>

<p>"The sky hath withdrawn the life of the star Septet
(Sothis, the Dog-star); behold Unas a living being, the
son of Septet. The Eighteen Gods have purified him in
Meskha (the Great Bear), [he is] an imperishable star. The
house of Unas perisheth not in the sky, the throne of Unas
perisheth not on the earth. Men make supplication [there],
the gods fly [thither]. Septet hath made Unas fly to heaven
to be with his brethren the gods. Nut,<a name="FNanchor_1_17" id="FNanchor_1_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_17" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the Great Lady,
hath unfolded her arms to Unas. She hath made them
into two divine souls at the head of the Souls of Anu, under
the head of R&#257;. She made them two weeping women when
thou wast on thy bier (?). The throne of Unas is by thee,
R&#257;, he yieldeth it not up to anyone else. Unas cometh
forth into heaven by thee, R&#257;. The face of Unas is like the
[faces of the] Hawks. The wings of Unas are like [those of]
geese. The nails of Unas are like the claws of the god Tuf.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_21" id="Pg_21" title="Pg_21">[21]</a></span>There is no [evil] word concerning Unas on earth among
men. There is no hostile speech about him with the gods.
Unas hath destroyed his word, he hath ascended to heaven.
Upuatu hath made Unas fly up to heaven among his brethren
the gods. Unas hath drawn together his arms like the Smen
goose, he striketh his wings like a falcon, flying, flying.
O men, Unas flieth up into heaven.</p>

<p>"O ye gods of the West, O ye gods of the East, O ye gods
of the South, O ye gods of the North, ye four groups who
embrace the holy lands, devote ye yourselves to Osiris when
he appeareth in heaven. He shall sail into the Sky, with
his son Horus by his fingers. He shall announce him, he
shall make him rise up like the Great God in the Sky. They
shall cry out concerning Unas: Behold Horus, the son of
Osiris! Behold Unas, the firstborn son of Hathor! Behold
the seed of Keb! Osiris hath commanded that Unas shall
rise as a second Horus, and these Four Spirit-souls in Anu
have written an edict to the two great gods in the Sky. R&#257;
set up the Ladder<a name="FNanchor_1_18" id="FNanchor_1_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_18" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in front of Osiris, Horus set up the Ladder
in front of his father Osiris when he went to his spirit, one
on this side [and] one on the other side; Unas is between
them. Behold, he is the god of the pure seats coming forth
from the bath (?). Unas standeth up, lo Horus; Unas
sitteth down, lo Set. R&#257; graspeth his hand, spirit to heaven,
body to earth."</p>

<p>The power of the king in heaven was almost as absolute
as it was upon earth, and in a very remarkable passage in
the text of Unas, which is repeated in the text of Teta, we
have a graphic description of the king as a mighty hunter,
who chases the gods and lassoes them, and then kills and
eats them in order that he may absorb their strength and
wisdom, and all their divine attributes, and their power of
living eternally. The passage reads:</p>

<p>"The skies lower, the Star-gods tremble, the Archers<a name="FNanchor_1_19" id="FNanchor_1_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_19" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
quake, the bones of the Akeru<a name="FNanchor_1_19b" id="FNanchor_1_19b"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_19" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> gods tremble, and those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_22" id="Pg_22" title="Pg_22">[22]</a></span>are with them are struck dumb when they see Unas rising up
as a soul, in the form of the god who liveth upon his fathers,
and who turneth his mothers into his food. Unas is the
lord of wisdom, and his mother knoweth not his name. The
adoration of Unas is in heaven, he hath become mighty in
the horizon like Temu, the father that gave him birth, and
after Temu had given him birth Unas became stronger than
his father. The Doubles (<i>i.e.</i> vital strength) of Unas are
behind him, the soles of his feet are beneath his feet, his gods
are over him, his serpents are [seated] upon his brow, the
serpent-guides of Unas are in front of him, and the spirit of
the flame looketh upon [his] soul. The powers of Unas protect
him. Unas is a bull in heaven. He directeth his steps
where he willeth. He liveth upon the form which each god
taketh upon himself, and he eateth the flesh of those who
come to fill their bellies with the magical charms in the Lake
of Fire. Unas is equipped with power against the spirit-souls
thereof, and he riseth in the form of the mighty one,
the lord of those who dwell in power (?). Unas hath taken
his seat with his back turned towards Keb (the Earth-god).
Unas hath weighed his words<a name="FNanchor_2_20" id="FNanchor_2_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_20" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> with the hidden god (?) who
hath no name, on the day of hacking in pieces the firstborn.
Unas is the lord of offerings, the untier of the knot, and he
himself maketh abundant the offerings of meat and drink.
Unas devoureth men, and liveth upon the gods, he is the
lord of envoys whom he sendeth forth on his missions. 'He
who cutteth off hairy scalps,' who dwelleth in the fields,
tieth the gods with ropes. Tcheser-tep shepherdeth them for
Unas and driveth them unto him; and the Cord-master
hath bound them for slaughter. Khensu, the slayer of the
wicked, cutteth their throats, and draweth out their intestines,
for it is he whom Unas sendeth to slaughter [them],
and Shesmu<a name="FNanchor_3_21" id="FNanchor_3_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_21" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> cutteth them in pieces, and boileth their
members in his blazing caldrons of the night. Unas eateth
their magical powers, and he swalloweth their spirit-souls.
The great ones among them serve for his meal at daybreak,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_23" id="Pg_23" title="Pg_23">[23]</a></span>the lesser serve for his meal at eventide, and the least among
them serve for his meal in the night. The old gods and the
old goddesses become fuel for his furnace. The mighty ones
in heaven light the fire under the caldrons wherein are heaped
up the thighs of the firstborn; and he who maketh those
who live in heaven to go about for Unas lighteth the fire
under the caldrons with the thighs of their women; he goeth
about the Two Heavens in their entirety, and he goeth round
about the two banks of the Celestial Nile. Unas is the Great
Power, the Power of Powers, and Unas is the Chief of the
gods in visible forms. Whatsoever he findeth upon his
path he eateth forthwith, and the magical might of Unas is
before that of all the spirit-bodies who dwell in the horizon.
Unas is the firstborn of the firstborn gods. Unas is surrounded
by thousands, and oblations are made unto him by
hundreds; he is made manifest as the Great Power by Saah
(Orion), the father of the gods. Unas repeateth his rising
in heaven, and he is crowned lord of the horizon. He hath
reckoned up the bandlets and the arm-rings [of his captives],
he hath taken possession of the hearts of the gods. Unas
hath eaten the Red Crown, and he hath swallowed the White
Crown; the food of Unas is the intestines, and his meat is
hearts and their words of power. Behold, Unas eateth of
that which the Red Crown sendeth forth, he increaseth, and
the words of power of the gods are in his belly; his attributes
are not removed from him. Unas hath eaten the whole
of the knowledge of every god, and the period of his life is
eternity, and the duration of his existence is everlastingness.
He is in the form of one who doeth what he wisheth, and who
doth not do what he hateth, and he abideth on the horizon
for ever and ever and ever. The Soul of the gods is in Unas,
their spirit-souls are with Unas, and the offerings made unto
him are more than those that are made unto the gods. The
fire of Unas is in their bones, for their soul is in Unas, and
their shades are with those who belong unto them. Unas
hath been with the two hidden (?) Kha (?) gods, ...; the
seat of the heart of Unas is among those who live upon this
earth for ever and ever and ever."</p>

<p>"Pepi was brought forth by the god Nu, when there was
no heaven, when there was no earth, when nothing had
been established, when there was no fighting, and when the
fear of the Eye of Horus did not exist. This Pepi is one
of the Great Offspring who were brought forth in Anu

ruled by chiefs, who are irresistible, whose words cannot be
gainsaid. Therefore this Pepi is irresistible; he can neither
be conquered by a king nor ruled by chiefs. The enemies
of Pepi cannot triumph. Pepi lacketh nothing. His nails
do not grow long [for want of prey]. No debt is reckoned
against Pepi. If Pepi falleth into the water Osiris will lift
him out, and the Two Companies of the Gods will bear him
up on their shoulders, and R&#257;, wheresoever he may be, will
give him his hand. If Pepi falleth on the earth the Earth-god
(Keb) will lift him up, and the Two Companies of the

he may be, will give him his hand.... Pepi appeareth
in heaven among the imperishable stars. His sister
the star Sothis (the Dog-star), his guide the Morning Star
(Venus) lead him by the hand to the Field of Offerings. He
taketh his seat on the crystal throne, which hath faces of
fierce lions and feet in the form of the hoofs of the Bull
Sma-ur. He standeth up in his place between the Two Great
Gods, and his sceptre and staff are in his hands. He lifteth
up his hand to the Henmemet spirits, and the gods come
to him with bowings. The Two Great Gods look on in their
places, and they find Pepi acting as judge of the gods. The
word of every spirit-soul is in him, and they make offerings
to him among the Two Companies of the Gods.<br /></p>

<h3>STORIES OF MAGICIANS WHO LIVED<br />
UNDER THE ANCIENT EMPIRE<br /><br /></h3>


<p>The short stories of the wonderful deeds of ancient
Egyptian magicians here given are found in the Westcar
Papyrus, which is preserved in the Royal Museum in Berlin,
where it is numbered P. 3033. This papyrus was the property
of Miss Westcar of Whitchurch, who gave it to the
eminent German Egyptologist, Richard Lepsius, in 1839;
it was written probably at some period between the twelfth
and eighteenth dynasties. The texts were first edited and
translated by Professor Erman.<br /><br /></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><b>The Magician Ubaaner and the Wax Crocodile</b></span></p>

<p>The first story describes an event which happened in the
reign of Nebka, a king of the third dynasty. It was told
by Prince Kh&#257;fr&#257; to King Khufu (Cheops). The magician
was called Ubaaner,<a name="FNanchor_1_22" id="FNanchor_1_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_22" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and he was the chief Kher-heb in the
temple of Ptah of Memphis, and a very learned man. He
was a married man, but his wife loved a young man who
worked in the fields, and she sent him by the hands of one
of her maids a box containing a supply of very fine clothes.
Soon after receiving this gift the young man proposed to the
magician's wife that they should meet and talk in a certain
booth or lodge in her garden, and she instructed the steward
to have the lodge made ready for her to receive her friend
in it. When this was done, she went to the lodge, and she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_26" id="Pg_26" title="Pg_26">[26]</a></span>sat there with the young man and drank beer with him
until the evening, when he went his way. The steward,
knowing what had happened, made up his mind to report
the matter to his master, and as soon as the morning had
come, he went to Ubaaner and informed him that his wife
had spent the previous day drinking beer with such and
such a young man. Ubaaner then told the steward to fetch
him his casket made of ebony and silver-gold, which contained
materials and instruments used in working magic,
and when it was brought him, he took out some wax, and
fashioned a figure of a crocodile seven spans long. He then
recited certain magical words over the crocodile, and said
to it, "When the young man comes to bathe in my lake
thou shalt seize him." Then giving the wax crocodile to
the steward, Ubaaner said to him, "When the young man
goes down to the lake to bathe according to his daily habit,
thou shalt throw the crocodile into the water after him."
Having taken the crocodile from his master the steward
departed.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_22" id="Footnote_1_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_22"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> This name means "splitter of stones." It will be remembered that the
late Sir H.M. Stanley was called the "stone-splitter," because of his great
strength of deed and word.</p></div>

<p>Then the wife of Ubaaner told the steward to set the
little lodge in the garden in order, because she was going
to spend some time there. When the steward had furnished
the lodge, she went there, and the young peasant paid her a
visit. After leaving the lodge he went and bathed in the
lake, and the steward followed him and threw the wax crocodile
into the water; it immediately turned into a large
crocodile 7 cubits (about 11 feet) long and seized the
young man and swallowed him up. When this took place
the magician Ubaaner was with the king, and he remained
in attendance upon him for seven days, during which time
the young man was in the lake, with no air to breathe.
When the seven days were ended King Nebka proposed to
take a walk with the magician. Whilst they were going
along Ubaaner asked the king if he would care to see a wonderful
thing that had happened to a young peasant, and the
king said he would, and forthwith walked to the place to
which the magician led him. When they arrived at the
lake Ubaaner uttered a spell over the crocodile, and commanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_27" id="Pg_27" title="Pg_27">[27]</a></span>it to come up out of the water bringing the young
man with him; and the crocodile did so. When the king
saw the beast he exclaimed at its hideousness, and seemed
to be afraid of it, but the magician stooped down fearlessly,
and took the crocodile up in his hand, and lo, the living
crocodile had disappeared, and only a crocodile of wax
remained in its place. Then Ubaaner told King Nebka the
story of how the young man had spent days in the lodge
in the garden talking and drinking beer with his wife, and
His Majesty said to the wax crocodile, "Get thee gone,
and take what is thine with thee." And the wax crocodile
leaped out of the magician's hand into the lake, and once
more became a large, living crocodile. And it swam away
with the young man, and no one ever knew what became
of it afterwards. Then the king made his servants seize
Ubaaner's wife, and they carried her off to the ground on
the north side of the royal palace, and there they burned
her, and they scattered her ashes in the river. When King
Khufu had heard the story he ordered many offerings to
be made in the tomb of his predecessor Nebka, and gifts
to be presented to the magician Ubaaner.<br /><br /></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><b>The Magician Tchatcham&#257;nkh and the Gold Ornament</b></span></p>

<p>The Prince Baiufr&#257; stood up and offered to relate to King
Khufu (Cheops) a story of a magician called Tchatcham&#257;nkh,
who flourished in the reign of Seneferu, the king's father.
The offer having been accepted, Baiufr&#257; proceeded to relate
the following: On one occasion it happened that Seneferu
was in a perplexed and gloomy state of mind, and he
wandered distractedly about the rooms and courts of his
palace seeking to find something wherewith to amuse himself,
but he failed to do so. Then he bethought himself of
the court magician Tchatcham&#257;nkh, and he ordered his
servants to summon him to the presence. When the great
Kher-heb and scribe arrived, he addressed him as "my
brother," and told him that he had been wandering about
in his palace seeking for amusement, and had failed to find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_28" id="Pg_28" title="Pg_28">[28]</a></span>it. The magician promptly suggested to the king that he
should have a boat got ready, decorated with pretty things
that would give pleasure, and should go for a row on the
lake. The motions of the rowers as they rowed the boat
about would interest him, and the sight of the depths of
the waters, and the pretty fields and gardens round about
the lake, would give him great pleasure. "Let me," said the
magician, "arrange the matter. Give me twenty ebony
paddles inlaid with gold and silver, and twenty pretty maidens
with flowing hair, and twenty network garments wherein
to dress them." The king gave orders for all these things
to be provided, and when the boat was ready, and the
maidens who were to row had taken their places, he entered
the boat and sat in his little pavilion and was rowed about
on the lake. The magician's views proved to be correct, for
the king enjoyed himself, and was greatly amused in watching
the maidens row. Presently the handle of the paddle
of one of the maidens caught in her long hair, and in trying
to free it a malachite ornament which she was wearing in
her hair fell into the water and disappeared. The maiden
was much troubled over her loss, and stopped rowing, and
as her stopping threw out of order the strokes of the maidens
who were sitting on the same seat as she was, they also
stopped rowing. Thereupon the king asked why the rowing
had ceased, and one of the maidens told him what had
happened; and when he promised that the ornament should
be recovered, the maiden said words which seem to mean
that she had no doubt that she should recover it. On this
Seneferu caused Tchatcham&#257;nkh to be summoned into the
presence, and when he came the king told him all that had
happened. Then the magician began to recite certain spells,
the effect of which was to cause the water of the lake first
to divide into two parts, and then the water on one side to
rise up and place itself on the water on the other side. The
boat, presumably, sank down gently on the ground of the
lake, for the malachite ornament was seen lying there, and
the magician fetched it, and returned it to its owner. The
depth of the water in the middle of the lake where the ornament
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_29" id="Pg_29" title="Pg_29">[29]</a></span>dropped was 12 cubits (between 18 and 19 feet),
and when the water from one side was piled up on that on
the other, the total depth of the two sections taken together
was, we are told, 24 cubits. As soon as the ornament
was restored to the maiden, the magician recited further
spells, and the water lowered itself, and spread over the
ground of the lake, and so regained its normal level. His
Majesty, King Seneferu, assembled his nobles, and having
discussed the matter with them, made a handsome gift to
his clever magician. When King Khufu had heard the
story he ordered a large supply of funerary offerings to be
sent to the tomb of Seneferu, and bread, beer, flesh, and
incense to the tomb of Tchatcham&#257;nkh.<br /><br /></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><b>The Magician Teta who Restored Life to Dead Animals, etc.</b></span></p>

<p>When Baiufr&#257; had finished the story given above, Prince
Herutataf, the son of King Khufu, and a very wise man,
with whose name Egyptian tradition associated the discovery
of certain chapters of the Book of the Dead, stood
up before his father to speak, and said to him, "Up to the
present thou hast only heard tales about the wisdom of
magicians who are dead and gone, concerning which it is
quite impossible to know whether they be true or not.
Now, I want Thy Majesty to see a certain sage who is actually
alive during thy lifetime, whom thou knowest not." His
Majesty Khufu said, "Who is it, Herutataf?" And Prince
Herutataf replied, "He is a certain peasant who is called
Teta, and he lives in Tet-Seneferu. He is one hundred and
ten years old, and up to this very day he eats five hundred
bread-cakes (<i>sic</i>), and a leg of beef, and drinks one hundred
pots of beer. He knows how to reunite to its body a head
which has been cut off, he knows how to make a lion follow
him whilst the rope with which he is tied drags behind
him on the ground, and he knows the numbers of the Apet
chambers (?) of the shrine (?) of Thoth." Now His Majesty
had been seeking for a long time past for the number of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_30" id="Pg_30" title="Pg_30">[30]</a></span>Apet chambers (?) of Thoth, for he had wished to make
something like it for his "horizon."<a name="FNanchor_1_23" id="FNanchor_1_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_23" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And King Khufu
said to his son Herutataf, "My son, thou thyself shalt go
and bring the sage to me"; thereupon a boat was made
ready for Prince Herutataf, who forthwith set out on his
journey to Tet-Seneferu, the home of the sage. When the
prince came to the spot on the river bank that was nearest
to the village of Teta, he had the boat tied up, and he continued
his journey overland seated in a sort of sedan chair
made of ebony, which was carried or slung on bearing poles
made of costly <i>sesentchem</i> wood inlaid or decorated with
gold. When Herutataf arrived at the village, the chair was
set down on the ground, and he got out of it and stood up
ready to greet the old man, whom he found lying upon a
bed, with the door of his house lying on the ground. One
servant stood by the bed holding the sage's head and fanning
him, and another was engaged in rubbing his feet. Herutataf
addressed a highly poetical speech to Teta, the gist of
which was that the old man seemed to be able to defy the
usual effects of old age, and to be like one who had obtained
the secret of everlasting youth, and then expressed the hope
that he was well. Having paid these compliments, which
were couched in dignified and archaic language, Herutataf
went on to say that he had come with a message from his
father Khufu, who hereby summoned Teta to his presence.
"I have come," he said, "a long way to invite thee, so
that thou mayest eat the food, and enjoy the good things
which the king bestows on those who follow him, and so
that he may conduct thee after a happy life to thy fathers
who rest in the grave." The sage replied, "Welcome, Prince
Herutataf, welcome, O thou who lovest thy father. Thy
father shall reward thee with gifts, and he shall promote
thee to the rank of the senior officials of his court. Thy
Ka<a name="FNanchor_2_24" id="FNanchor_2_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_24" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> shall fight successfully against thine enemy, thy soul
knows the ways of the Other World, and thou shalt arrive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_31" id="Pg_31" title="Pg_31">[31]</a></span>at the door of those who are apparelled in ... I salute
thee, O Prince Herutataf."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_23" id="Footnote_1_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_23"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> These were probably books and instruments which the magicians of the
day used in making astrological calculations, or in working magic.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_24" id="Footnote_2_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_24"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The "double," or the vital force.</p></div>

<p>Herutataf then held out his hands to the sage and helped
him to rise from the bed, and he went with him to the river
bank, Teta leaning on his arm. When they arrived there
Teta asked for a boat wherein his children and his books
might be placed, and the prince put at his disposal two
boats, with crews complete; Teta himself, however, was
accommodated in the prince's boat and sailed with him.
When they came to the palace, Prince Herutataf went into
the presence of the king to announce their arrival, and said
to him, "O king my lord, I have brought Teta"; and His
Majesty replied, "Bring him in quickly." Then the king
went out into the large hall of his palace, and Teta was led
into the presence. His Majesty said, "How is it, Teta,
that I have never seen thee?" And Teta answered, "Only
the man who is summoned to the presence comes; so soon
as the king summoned me I came." His Majesty asked him,
saying, "Is it indeed true, as is asserted, that thou knowest
how to rejoin to its body the head which hath been cut off?"
Teta answered, "Most assuredly do I know how to do this,
O king my lord." His Majesty said, "Let them bring in
from the prison a prisoner, so that his death-sentence may
be carried out." Then Teta said, "Let them not bring a
man, O king my lord. Perhaps it may be ordered that
the head shall be cut off some other living creature." So
a goose was brought to him, and he cut off its head, and
laid the body of the goose on the west side of the hall, and
its head on the east side. Then Teta recited certain magical
spells, and the goose stood up and waddled towards its head,
and its head moved towards its body. When the body
and the head came close together, the head leaped on to
the body, and the goose stood up on its legs and cackled.</p>

<p>Then a goose of another kind called <i>khet&acirc;a</i> was brought
to Teta, and he did with it as he had done with the other
goose. His Majesty next caused an ox to be taken to Teta,
and when he had cut off its head, and recited magical spells
over the head and the body, the head rejoined itself to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_32" id="Pg_32" title="Pg_32">[32]</a></span>body, and the ox stood up on its feet. A lion was next
brought to Teta, and when he had recited spells over it, the
lion went behind him, and followed him [like a dog], and
the rope with which he had been tied up trailed on the
ground behind the animal.</p>

<p>King Khufu then said to Teta, "Is it true what they say
that thou knowest the numbers of the Apet chambers (?)
of the shrine (?) of Thoth?" Teta replied, "No. I do not
know their number, O king my lord, but I do know the
place where they are to be found." His Majesty asked,
"Where is that?" Teta replied, "There is a box made
of flint in a house called Sapti in Heliopolis." The king
asked, "Who will bring me this box?" Teta replied,
"Behold, O king my lord, I shall not bring the box to thee."
His Majesty asked, "Who then shall bring it to me?" Teta
answered, "The oldest of the three children of Rut-tetet
shall bring it unto thee." His Majesty said, "It is my
will that thou shalt tell me who this Rut-tetet is." Teta
answered, "This Rut-tetet is the wife of a priest of R&#257; of
Sakhabu,<a name="FNanchor_1_25" id="FNanchor_1_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_25" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> who is about to give birth to three children of
R&#257;. He told her that these children should attain to the
highest dignities in the whole country, and that the oldest
of them should become high priest<a name="FNanchor_2_26" id="FNanchor_2_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_26" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of Heliopolis." On
hearing these words the heart of the king became sad; and
Teta said, "Wherefore art thou so sad, O king my lord?
Is it because of the three children? I say unto thee, Verily
thy son, verily his son, verily one of them." His Majesty
asked, "When will these three children be born?" Teta
answered, "Rut-tetet will give them birth on the fifteenth
day of the first month of Pert."<a name="FNanchor_3_27" id="FNanchor_3_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_27" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The king then made a
remark the exact meaning of which it is difficult to follow,
but from one part of it it is clear that he expressed his determination
to go and visit the temple of R&#257; of Sakhabu, which
seems to have been situated on or near the great canal of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_33" id="Pg_33" title="Pg_33">[33]</a></span>the Letopolite nome. In reply Teta declared that he would
take care that the water in the canal should be 4 cubits
(about 6 feet) deep, <i>i.e.</i> that the water should be deep
enough for the royal barge to sail on the canal without
difficulty. The king then returned to his palace and gave
orders that Teta should have lodgings given him in the
house of Prince Herutataf, that he should live with him,
and that he should be provided with one thousand bread-cakes,
one hundred pots of beer, one ox, and one hundred
bundles of vegetables. And all that the king commanded
concerning Teta was done.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><b>The Story of Rut-tetet and the Three Sons of R&#257;</b></span></p>

<p>The last section of the Westcar Papyrus deals with the
birth of the three sons of R&#257;, who have been mentioned
above. When the day drew nigh in which the three sons
were to be born, R&#257;, the Sun-god, ordered the four goddesses,
Isis, Nephthys,<a name="FNanchor_1_28" id="FNanchor_1_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_28" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Meskhenet,<a name="FNanchor_2_29" id="FNanchor_2_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_29" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and Heqet,<a name="FNanchor_3_30" id="FNanchor_3_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_30" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and the
god Khnemu,<a name="FNanchor_4_31" id="FNanchor_4_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_31" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> to go and superintend the birth of the three
children, so that when they grew up, and were exercising
the functions of rule throughout all Egypt, they should
build temples to them, and furnish the altars in them with
offerings of meat and drink in abundance. Then the four
goddesses changed themselves into the forms of dancing
women, and went to the house wherein the lady Rut-tetet lay
ill, and finding her husband, the priest of R&#257;, who was called
R&#257;user, outside, they clashed their cymbals together, and
rattled their sistra, and tried to make him merry. When
R&#257;user objected to this and told them that his wife lay ill
inside the house, they replied, "Let us see her, for we know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_34" id="Pg_34" title="Pg_34">[34]</a></span>how to help her"; so he said to them and to Khnemu who
was with them, "Enter in," and they did so, and they went
to the room wherein Rut-tetet lay. Isis, Nephthys, and
Heqet assisted in bringing the three boys into the world.
Meskhenet prophesied for each of them sovereignty over
the land, and Khnemu bestowed health upon their bodies.
After the birth of the three boys, the four goddesses and
Khnemu went outside the house, and told R&#257;user to rejoice
because his wife Rut-tetet had given him three children.
R&#257;user said, "My Ladies, what can I do for you in return
for this?" Having apparently nothing else to give them,
he begged them to have barley brought from his granary,
so that they might take it away as a gift to their own
granaries; they agreed, and the god Khnemu brought the
barley. So the goddesses set out to go to the place whence
they had come.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_28" id="Footnote_1_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_28"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Isis and Nephthys were the daughters of Keb and Nut, and sisters of
Osiris and Set; the former was the mother of Horus, and the latter of
Anubis.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_29" id="Footnote_2_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_29"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> A goddess who presided over the birth of children.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_30" id="Footnote_3_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_30"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> A very ancient Frog-goddess, who was associated with generation and

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_31" id="Footnote_4_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_31"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> A god who assisted at the creation of the world, and who fashioned the
bodies of men and women.</p></div>

<p>When they had arrived there Isis said to her companions:
"How is it that we who went to Rut-tetet [by the command
of R&#257;] have worked no wonder for the children which we
could have announced to their father, who allowed us to
depart [without begging a boon]?" So they made divine
crowns such as belonged to the Lord (<i>i.e.</i> King), life, strength,
health [be to him!], and they hid them in the barley. Then
they sent rain and storm through the heavens, and they
went back to the house of R&#257;user, apparently carrying the
barley with them, and said to him, "Let the barley abide
in a sealed room until we dance our way back to the north."
So they put the barley in a sealed room. After Rut-tetet
had kept herself secluded for fourteen days, she said to one
of her handmaidens, "Is the house all ready?" and the
handmaiden told her that it was provided with everything
except jars of barley drink, which had not been brought.
Rut-tetet then asked why they had not been brought, and
the handmaiden replied in words that seem to mean that
there was no barley in the house except that which belonged
to the dancing goddesses, and that that was in a chamber
which had been sealed with their seal. Rut-tetet then told
her to go and fetch some of the barley, for she was quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_35" id="Pg_35" title="Pg_35">[35]</a></span>certain that when her husband R&#257;user returned he would
make good what she took. Thereupon the handmaiden
went to the chamber, and broke it open, and she heard in
it loud cries and shouts, and the sounds of music and singing
and dancing, and all the noises which men make in honour
of the birth of a king, and she went back and told Rut-tetet
what she had heard. Then Rut-tetet herself went through
the room, and could not find the place where the noises
came from, but when she laid her temple against a box, she
perceived that the noises were inside it. She then took this
box, which cannot have been of any great size, and put it
in another box, which in turn she put in another box, which
she sealed, and then wrapping this in a leather covering,
she laid it in a chamber containing her jar of barley beer
or barley wine, and sealed the door. When R&#257;user returned
from the fields, Rut-tetet related to him everything that
had happened, and his heart was exceedingly glad, and he
and his wife sat down and enjoyed themselves.</p>

<p>A few days after these events Rut-tetet had a quarrel
with her handmaiden, and she slapped her well. The handmaiden
was very angry, and in the presence of the household
she said words to this effect: Dost thou dare to treat
me in this way? I who can destroy thee? She has given
birth to three kings, and I will go and tell the Majesty of
King Khufu of this fact. The handmaiden thought that,
if Khufu knew of the views of R&#257;user and Rut-tetet about
the future of their three sons, and the prophecies of the
goddesses, he would kill the children and perhaps their parents
also. With the object in her mind of telling the king the
handmaiden went to her maternal uncle, whom she found
weaving flax on the walk, and told him what had happened,
and said she was going to tell the king about the three
children. From her uncle she obtained neither support
nor sympathy; on the contrary, gathering together several
strands of flax into a thick rope he gave her a good beating
with the same. A little later the handmaiden went to the
river or canal to fetch some water, and whilst she was filling
her pot a crocodile seized her and carried her away and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_36" id="Pg_36" title="Pg_36">[36]</a></span>presumably, ate her. Then the uncle went to the house
of Rut-tetet to tell her what had happened, and he found
her sitting down, with her head bowed over her breast, and
exceedingly sad and miserable. He asked her, saying, "O
Lady, wherefore art thou so sad?" And she told him
that the cause of her sorrow was the handmaiden, who had
been born in the house and had grown up in it, and who
had just left it, threatening that she would go and tell the
king about the birth of the three kings. The uncle of the
handmaiden nodded his head in a consoling manner, and
told Rut-tetet how she had come to him and informed him
what she was going to do, and how he had given her a good
beating with a rope of flax, and how she had gone to the
river to fetch some water, and how a crocodile had carried
her off.</p>

<p>There is reason to think that the three sons of Rut-tetet
became the three kings of the fifth dynasty who were known
by the names of Kh&#257;fr&#257;, Menkaur&#257;, and Userkaf. The
stories given above are valuable because they contain elements
of history, for it is now well known that the immediate successors
of the fourth dynasty, of which Khufu, Kh&#257;fr&#257;, and
Menkaur&#257;, the builders of the three great pyramids at
G&#299;zah, were the most important kings, were kings who
delighted to call themselves sons of R&#257;, and who spared
no effort to make the form of worship of the Sun-god that
was practised at Anu, or Heliopolis, universal in Egypt.
It is probable that the three magicians, Ubaaner, Tchatcham&#257;nkh,
and Teta were historical personages, whose abilities
and skill in working magic appealed to the imagination of
the Egyptians under all dynasties, and caused their names
to be venerated to a remote posterity.<br /><br /></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE BOOK OF THE DEAD<br /><br /></h3>


<p>"Book of the Dead" is the name that is now generally
given to the large collection of "Chapters," or compositions,
both short and long, which the ancient Egyptians cut upon
the walls of the corridors and chambers in pyramids and
rock-hewn tombs, and cut or painted upon the insides and
outsides of coffins and sarcophagi, and wrote upon papyri, etc.,
which were buried with the dead in their tombs. The first
modern scholar to study these Chapters was the eminent
Frenchman, J. Fran&ccedil;ois Champollion; he rightly concluded
that all of them were of a religious character, but he was
wrong in calling the collection as a whole "Funerary Ritual."
The name "Book of the Dead" is a translation of the title
"Todtenbuch," given by Dr. R. Lepsius to his edition
of a papyrus at Turin, containing a very long selection of the
Chapters,<a name="FNanchor_1_32" id="FNanchor_1_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_32" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which he published in 1842. "Book of the Dead"
is on the whole a very satisfactory general description of
these Chapters, for they deal almost entirely with the dead,
and they were written entirely for the dead. They have
nothing to do with the worship of the gods by those who
live on the earth, and such prayers and hymns as are incorporated
with them were supposed to be said and sung by
the dead for their own benefit. The author of the Chapters
of the Book of the Dead was the god Thoth, whose greatness
has already been described in Chapter I of this book. Thus
they were considered to be of divine origin, and were held
in the greatest reverence by the Egyptians at all periods of
their long history. They do not all belong to the same
period, for many of them allude to the dismemberment and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_38" id="Pg_38" title="Pg_38">[38]</a></span>burning of the dead, customs that, though common enough
in very primitive times, were abandoned soon after royal
dynasties became established in Egypt.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_32" id="Footnote_1_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_32"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The actual number of Chapters in this papyrus is 165.</p></div>

<p>It is probable that in one form or another many of the
Chapters were in existence in the predynastic period,<a name="FNanchor_1_33" id="FNanchor_1_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_33" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> but
no copies of such primitive versions, if they ever existed,
have come down to us. One Egyptian tradition, which is at
least as old as the early part of the eighteenth dynasty (1600
B.C.), states that Chapters XXXB and LXIV were "discovered"
during the reign of Semti, a king of the first dynasty,
and another tradition assigns their discovery to the reign of
Menkaur&#257; (the Mycerinus of classical writers), a king of the
fourth dynasty. It is certain, however, that the Egyptians
possessed a Book of the Dead which was used for kings and
royal personages, at least, early under the first dynasty, and
that, in a form more or less complete, it was in use down to
the time of the coming of Christianity into Egypt. The
tombs of the officials of the third and fourth dynasties
prove that the Book of Opening the Mouth and the Liturgy
of Funerary Offerings (see pp. 13-18) were in use when
they were made, and this being so it follows as a matter
of course that at this period the Egyptians believed in the
resurrection of the dead and in their immortality, that the
religion of Osiris was generally accepted, that the efficacy
of funerary offerings was unquestioned by the religious, and
that men died believing that those who were righteous on
earth would be rewarded in heaven, and that the evil-doer
would be punished. The Pyramid Texts also prove that a
Book of the Dead divided into chapters was in existence
when they were written, for they mention the "Chapter of
those who come forth (<i>i.e.</i> appear in heaven)," and the
"Chapter of those who rise up" (Pepi I, l. 463), and the
"Chapter of the <i>betu</i> incense," and the "Chapter of the
natron incense" (Pepi I, 469). Whether these Chapters
formed parts of the Pyramid Texts, or whether both they
and the Pyramid Texts belonged to the Book of the Dead
cannot be said, but it seems clear that the four Chapters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_39" id="Pg_39" title="Pg_39">[39]</a></span>mentioned above formed part of a work belonging to a Book
of the Dead that was older than the Pyramid Texts. This
Book of the Dead was no doubt based upon the beliefs of the
followers of the religion of Osiris, which began in the Delta
and spread southwards into Upper Egypt. Its doctrines
must have differed in many important particulars from
those of the worshippers of the Sun-god of Heliopolis, whose
priests preached the existence of a heaven of a solar character,
and taught their followers to believe in the Sun-god
R&#257;, and not in Temu, the ancient native god of Heliopolis,
and not in the divine man Osiris. The exposition of
the Heliopolitan creed is found in the Pyramid Texts, which
also contain the proofs that before the close of the sixth
dynasty the cult of Osiris had vanquished the cult of R&#257;,
and that the religion of Osiris had triumphed.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_33" id="Footnote_1_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_33"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <i>i.e.</i> before Menes became king of both Upper and Lower Egypt.</p></div>

<p>Certain of the Chapters of the Book of the Dead (<i>e.g.</i> XXXB
and LXIV) were written in the city of Thoth, or Khemenu,
others were written in Anu, or Heliopolis, and others in
Busiris and other towns of the Delta. Of the Book of the
Dead that was in use under the fifth and sixth dynasties
we have no copies, but many Chapters of the Recension
in use under the eleventh and twelfth dynasties are found
written in cursive hieroglyphs upon wooden sarcophagi,
many of which may be seen in the British Museum. With
the beginning of the eighteenth dynasty the Book of the
Dead enters a new phase of its existence, and it became
the custom to write it on rolls of papyrus, which were laid
with the dead in their coffins, instead of on the coffins themselves.
As the greater number of such rolls have been found
in the tombs of priests and others at Thebes, the Recension
that was in use from the eighteenth to the twenty-first
dynasty (1600-900 B.C.) is commonly called the <span class="smcap">Theban
Recension</span>. This Recension, in its earliest form, is usually
written with black ink in vertical columns of hieroglyphs,
which are separated by black lines; the titles of the Chapters,
the opening words of each section, and the Rubrics are
written with red ink. About the middle of the eighteenth
dynasty pictures painted in bright colours, "vignettes,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_40" id="Pg_40" title="Pg_40">[40]</a></span>were added to the Chapters; these are very valuable, because
they sometimes explain or give a clue to the meaning of parts
of the texts that are obscure. Under the twentieth and
twenty-first dynasties the writing of copies of the Book
of the Dead in hieroglyphs went out of fashion, and copies
written in the hieratic, or cursive, character took their place.
These were ornamented with vignettes drawn in outline with
black ink, and although the scribes who made them wrote
certain sections in hieroglyphs, it is clear that they did not
possess the skill of the great scribes who flourished between
1600 and 1050 B.C. The last Recension of the Book of the
Dead known to us in a complete form is the <span class="smcap">Sa&#299;te Recension</span>,
which came into existence about 600 B.C., and continued
in use from that time to the Roman Period. In the Ptolemaic
and Roman Periods the priests composed several small works
such as the "Book of Breathings" and the "Book of
Traversing Eternity," which were based upon the Book of
the Dead, and were supposed to contain in a highly condensed
form all the texts that were necessary for salvation.
At a still later period even more abbreviated texts came
into use, and the Book of the Dead ended its existence in
the form of a series of almost illegible scrawls traced upon
scraps of papyrus only a few inches square.</p>

<p>Rolls of papyrus containing the Book of the Dead were
placed: (1) In a niche in the wall of the mummy chamber;
(2) in the coffin by the side of the deceased, or laid between
the thighs or just above the ankles; (3) in hollow wooden
figures of the god Osiris, or Ptah-Seker-Osiris, or in the
hollow pedestals on which such figures stood.</p>

<p>The Egyptians believed that the souls of the dead on
leaving this world had to traverse a vast and difficult region
called the Tuat, which was inhabited by gods, devils, fiends,
demons, good spirits, bad spirits, and the souls of the wicked,
to say nothing of snakes, serpents, savage animals, and
monsters, before they could reach the Elysian Fields, and
appear in the presence of Osiris. The Tuat was like the
African "bush," and had no roads through it. In primitive
times the Egyptians thought that only those souls that were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_41" id="Pg_41" title="Pg_41">[41]</a></span>provided with spells, incantations, prayers, charms, words of
power, and amulets could ever hope to reach the Kingdom
of Osiris. The spells and incantations were needed for the
bewitchment of hostile beings of every kind; the prayers,
charms, and words of power were necessary for making
other kinds of beings that possessed great powers to help
the soul on its journey, and to deliver it from foes; and the
amulets gave the soul that was equipped with them strength,
power, will, and knowledge to employ successfully every
means of assistance that presented itself.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Object of the Book of the Dead</span> was to provide the
dead man with all these spells, prayers, amulets, &amp;c., and to
enable him to overcome all the dangers and difficulties of the
Tuat, and to reach Sekhet Aaru and Sekhet Hetep (the
Elysian Fields), and to take his place among the subjects of
Osiris in the Land of Everlasting Life. As time went on the
beliefs of the Egyptians changed considerably about many
important matters, but they never attempted to alter the
Chapters of the Book of the Dead so as to bring them, if we
may use the expression, "up to date." The religion of the
eighteenth dynasty was far higher in its spiritual character
generally than that of the twelfth dynasty, but the Chapters
that were used under the twelfth dynasty were used under
the eighteenth, and even under the twenty-sixth dynasty.
In religion the Egyptian forgot nothing and abandoned
nothing; what was good enough for his ancestors was good
enough for him, and he was content to go into the next
world relying for his salvation on the texts which he thought
had procured their salvation. Thus the Book of the Dead
as a whole is a work that reflects all the religious beliefs of
the Egyptians from the time when they were half savages
to the period of the final downfall of their power.</p>

<p>The Theban Recension of the Book of the Dead contains
about one hundred and ninety Chapters, many of which
have Rubrics stating what effects will be produced by their
recital, and describing ceremonies that must be performed
whilst they are being recited. It is impossible to describe
the contents of all the Chapters in our limited space, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_42" id="Pg_42" title="Pg_42">[42]</a></span>in the following brief summary the most important are enumerated.
Chap. 1 contains the formulas that were recited on
the day of the funeral. Chap. 151 gives a picture of the
arrangement of the mummy chamber, and the texts to be
said in it. Chap. 137 describes certain magical ceremonies
that were performed in the mummy chamber, and describes
the objects of magical power that were placed in niches in
the four walls. Chap. 125 gives a picture of the Judgment
Hall of Osiris, and supplies the declarations of innocence
that the deceased made before the Forty-two Judges.
Chaps. 144-147, 149, and 150 describe the Halls, Pylons,
and Divisions of the Kingdom of Osiris, and supply the name
of the gods who guard them, and the formulas to be said by
the deceased as he comes to each. Chap. 110 gives a picture
of the Elysian Fields and a text describing all the towns
and places in them. Chap. 5 is a spell by the use of which
the deceased avoided doing work, and Chap. 6 is another,
the recital of which made a figure to work for him. Chap. 15
contains hymns to the rising and to the setting sun, and a
Litany of Osiris; and Chap. 183 is a hymn to Osiris. Chaps.
2, 3, 12, 13, and others enabled a man to move about freely
in the Other World; Chap. 9 secured his free passage in and
out of the tomb; and Chap. 11 overthrew his enemies.
Chap. 17 deals with important beliefs as to the origin of God
and the gods, and of the heavens and the earth, and states
the different opinions which Egyptian theologians held
about many divine and mythological beings. The reason
for including it in the Book of the Dead is not quite clear,
but that it was a most important Chapter is beyond all
doubt. Chaps. 21 and 22 restored his mouth to the deceased,
and Chap. 23 enabled him to open it. Chap. 24 supplied
him with words of power, and Chap. 25 restored to him his
memory. Chaps. 26-30B gave to the deceased his heart,
and supplied the spells that prevented the stealers of hearts
from carrying it off, or from injuring it in any way. Two
of these Chapters (29 and 30B) were cut upon amulets made
in the form of a human heart. Chaps. 31 and 32 are spells
for driving away crocodiles, and Chaps. 33-38, and 40
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_43" id="Pg_43" title="Pg_43">[43]</a></span>are spells against snakes and serpents. Chaps. 41 and 42
preserved a man from slaughter in the Other World, Chap. 43
enabled him to avoid decapitation, and Chap. 44 preserved
him from the second death. Chaps. 45, 46, and 154 protected
the body from rot or decay and worms in the tomb.
Chap. 50 saved the deceased from the headsman in the Tuat,
and Chap. 51 enabled him to avoid stumbling. Chaps. 38,
52-60, and 62 ensured for him a supply of air and water in
the Tuat, and Chap. 63 protected him from drinking boiling
water there. Chaps. 64-74 gave him the power to leave the
tomb, to overthrow enemies, and to "come forth by day."
Chaps. 76-89 enabled a man to transform himself into the
Light-god, the primeval soul of God, the gods Ptah and
Osiris, a golden hawk, a divine hawk, a lotus, a <i>benu</i> bird,
a heron, a swallow, a serpent, a crocodile, and into any being
or thing he pleased. Chap. 89 enabled the soul of the
deceased to rejoin its body at pleasure, and Chaps. 91 and 92
secured the egress of his soul and spirit from the tomb.
Chaps. 94-97 made the deceased an associate of Thoth, and
Chaps. 98 and 99 secured for him the use of the magical
boat, and the services of the celestial ferryman, who would
ferry him across the river in the Tuat to the Island of Fire,
in which Osiris lived. Chaps. 101 and 102 provided access
for him to the Boat of R&#257;. Chaps. 108, 109, 112, and 116
enabled him to know the Souls (<i>i.e.</i> gods) of the East and
West, and of the towns of Pe,<a name="FNanchor_1_34" id="FNanchor_1_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_34" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Nekhen,<a name="FNanchor_2_35" id="FNanchor_2_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_35" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Khemenu,<a name="FNanchor_3_36" id="FNanchor_3_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_36" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and
Anu.<a name="FNanchor_4_37" id="FNanchor_4_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_37" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Chaps. 117-119 enabled him to find his way through
Rastau, a part of the kingdom of Seker, the god of Death.
Chap. 152 enabled him to build a house, and Chap. 132 gave
him power to return to the earth and see it. Chap. 153
provided for his escape from the fiend who went about to
take souls in a net. Chaps. 155-160, 166, and 167 formed
the spells that were engraved on amulets, <i>i.e.</i> the Tet (male),
the Tet (female), the Vulture, the Collar, the Sceptre, the
Pillow, the Pectoral, &amp;c., and gave to the deceased the
power of Osiris and Isis and other gods, and restored to him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_44" id="Pg_44" title="Pg_44">[44]</a></span>his heart, and lifted up his head. Chap. 162 kept heat in the
body until the day of the resurrection. Chaps. 175 and 176
gave the deceased everlasting life and enabled him to escape
the second death. Chap. 177 raised up the dead body, and
Chap. 178 raised up the spirit-soul. The remaining Chapters
perfected the spirit-soul, and gave it celestial powers, and
enabled it to enjoy intercourse with the gods as an equal,
and enabled it to participate in all their occupations and
pleasures. We may now give a few extracts that will give
an idea of the contents of some of the most important
passages.</p>

<p>The following is the opening hymn to Osiris in the Papyrus
of Ani:</p>

<p>"Glory be to Osiris Un-Nefer, the great god who dwelleth
in Abydos, king of eternity, lord of everlastingness, whose
existence endureth for millions of years. Eldest son of the
womb of Nut,<a name="FNanchor_1_38" id="FNanchor_1_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_38" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> begotten by Keb,<a name="FNanchor_2_39" id="FNanchor_2_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_39" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the Erp&#257;t,<a name="FNanchor_3_40" id="FNanchor_3_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_40" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> lord of the

the whip, and the rank of his divine fathers. Let thy heart
in Semt-Ament<a name="FNanchor_4_41" id="FNanchor_4_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_41" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> be content, for thy son Horus is established
on thy throne. Thou art crowned lord of Tatu<a name="FNanchor_5_42" id="FNanchor_5_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_42" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and
ruler in Abydos.<a name="FNanchor_6_43" id="FNanchor_6_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_43" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Through thee the world flourisheth in

name of 'Seker'; he is exceedingly mighty and most
terrible in his name of 'Osiris'; he endureth for ever and
ever in his name of 'Un-Nefer.' Homage to thee, O King

<p>In another Hymn to Osiris, which is found in the Papyrus
of Hunefer, we have the following: "The gods come unto
thee, bowing low before thee, and they hold thee in fear.
They withdraw and depart when they see thee endued with
the terror of R&#257;, and the victory of Thy Majesty is over
their hearts. Life is with thee, and offerings of meat and
drink follow thee, and that which is thy due is offered before
thy face. I have come unto thee holding in my hands truth,
and my heart hath in it no cunning (or deceit). I offer unto
thee that which is thy due, and I know that whereon thou
livest. I have not committed any kind of sin in the land;
I have defrauded no man of what is his. I am Thoth, the
perfect scribe, whose hands are pure. I am the lord of
purity, the destroyer of evil, the scribe of truth; what I
abominate is sin."</p>

<p>Here is an address, followed by a short Litany, which
forms a kind of introduction to Chapter 15 in the Papyrus
of Ani:</p>

<p>"Praise be unto thee, O Osiris, lord of eternity, Un-Nefer,
Heru-Khuti, whose forms are manifold, whose attributes are
majesty, [thou who art] Ptah-Seker-Tem in Heliopolis, lord
of the Sheta shrine, creator of Het-ka-Ptah (Memphis) and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_46" id="Pg_46" title="Pg_46">[46]</a></span>of the gods who dwell therein, thou Guide of the Other
World, whom the gods praise when thou settest in the sky.
Isis embraceth thee contentedly, and she driveth away the
fiends from the mouth of thy paths. Thou turnest thy face
towards Amentet,<a name="FNanchor_1_50" id="FNanchor_1_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_50" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and thou makest the earth to shine like
refined copper. The dead rise up to look upon thee, they
breathe the air, and they behold thy face when [thy] disk
riseth on the horizon. Their hearts are at peace, inasmuch
as they behold thee, O thou who art Eternity and Everlastingness.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Litany</span></h3>

<p>"1. Homage to thee, O [Lord of] the Dekans<a name="FNanchor_1_51" id="FNanchor_1_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_51" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in Heliopolis
and of the heavenly beings in Kher&#257;ha,<a name="FNanchor_2_52" id="FNanchor_2_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_52" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> thou god Unti, who
art the most glorious of the gods hidden in Heliopolis.</p>

<p>"<i>Grant thou unto me a path whereon I may pass in peace,

have I done aught with deceit</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3_53" id="FNanchor_3_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_53" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

long strides dost thou stride over heaven, O Heru-Khuti.</p>

<p>"3. Homage to thee, O Everlasting Soul, who dwellest in
Tatu (Busiris), Un-Nefer,<a name="FNanchor_6_56" id="FNanchor_6_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_56" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> son of Nut, who art the Lord
of Akert.</p>

<p>"4. Homage to thee in thy rule over Tatu. The Urrt
Crown is fixed upon thy head. Thou art One, thou createst
thy protection, thou dwellest in peace in Tatu.</p>

<p>"5. Homage to thee, O Lord of the Acacia. The Seker
Boat<a name="FNanchor_7_57" id="FNanchor_7_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_57" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> is on its sledge; thou turnest back the Fiend, the
worker of evil; thou makest the Eye of the Sun-god to rest
upon its throne.</p>

<p>"6. Homage to thee, mighty one in thine hour, Prince
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_47" id="Pg_47" title="Pg_47">[47]</a></span>great and mighty, dweller in Anrutef,<a name="FNanchor_8_58" id="FNanchor_8_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_58" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> lord of eternity,
creator of everlastingness. Thou art the lord of Hensu.<a name="FNanchor_9_59" id="FNanchor_9_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_59" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>"7. Homage to thee, O thou who restest upon Truth.
Thou art the Lord of Abydos; thy body is joined to
Ta-Tchesert. Thou art he to whom fraud and deceit are
abominable.</p>

<p>"8. Homage to thee, O dweller in thy boat. Thou leadest
the Nile from his source, the light shineth upon thy body;
thou art the dweller in Nekhen.<a name="FNanchor_10_60" id="FNanchor_10_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_60" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>"9. Homage to thee, O Creator of the gods, King of the
South, King of the North, Osiris, Conqueror, Governor of
the world in thy gracious seasons! Thou art the Lord
of the heaven of Egypt (Atebui)."</p>

<p>The following passage illustrates the general character
of a funerary hymn to R&#257;: "Homage to thee, O thou who
art in the form of Khepera, Khepera the creator of the gods.
Thou risest, thou shinest, thou illuminest thy mother [the
sky]. Thou art crowned King of the Gods. Mother Nut<a name="FNanchor_1_61" id="FNanchor_1_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_61" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
welcometh thee with bowings. The Land of Sunset (Manu)
receiveth thee with satisfaction, and the goddess Ma&#257;t<a name="FNanchor_2_62" id="FNanchor_2_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_62" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
embraceth thee at morn and at eve. Hail, ye gods of the
Temple of the Soul (<i>i.e.</i> heaven), who weigh heaven and
earth in a balance, who provide celestial food! And hail,
Tatunen,<a name="FNanchor_3_63" id="FNanchor_3_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_63" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> One, Creator of man, Maker of the gods of the
south and of the north, of the west and of the east! Come
ye and acclaim R&#257;, the Lord of heaven, the Prince&mdash;life,
health, strength be to him!&mdash;the Creator of the gods, and
adore ye him in his beautiful form as he riseth in his Morning
Boat (&#256;ntchet).</p>

<p>"Those who dwell in the heights and those who dwell in
the depths worship thee. Thoth and the goddess Ma&#257;t
have laid down thy course for thee daily for ever. Thine
Enemy the Serpent hath been cast into the fire, the fiend
hath fallen down into it headlong. His arms have been
bound in chains, and R&#257; hath hacked off his legs; the

Aged God [in Anu] keepeth festival, and the sound of those
who rejoice is in the Great House. The gods shout for joy
when they see R&#257; rising, and when his beams are filling the
world with light. The Majesty of the Holy God goeth forth
and advanceth even unto the Land of Sunset (Manu). He
maketh bright the earth at his birth daily, he journeyeth
to the place where he was yesterday. O be thou at peace
with me, and let me behold thy beauties! Let me appear
on the earth. Let me smite [the Eater of] the Ass.<a name="FNanchor_5_65" id="FNanchor_5_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_65" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Let

and the Ant Fish<a name="FNanchor_8_68" id="FNanchor_8_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_68" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in its lake. Let me see Horus steering
thy boat, with Thoth and Ma&#257;t standing one on each side
of him. Let me have hold of the bows of [thy] Evening
Boat and the stern of thy Morning Boat.<a name="FNanchor_9_69" id="FNanchor_9_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_69" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Grant thou unto
the Ka of me, the Osiris the scribe Ani, to behold the disk
of the Sun, and to see the Moon-god regularly and daily.
Let my soul come forth and walk hither and thither and
whithersoever it pleaseth. Let my name be read from the
list of those who are to receive offerings, and may offerings
be set before me, even as they are set before the Followers
of Horus. Let there be prepared for me a seat in the
Boat of R&#257; on the day when the god goeth forth. Let me
be received into the presence of Osiris, in the Land where
Truth is spoken."</p>

<p>The prayers of the Book of the Dead consist usually of a
string of petitions for sepulchral offerings to be offered in the
tombs of the petitioners, and the fundamental idea underlying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_49" id="Pg_49" title="Pg_49">[49]</a></span>them is that by their transmutation, which was effected
by the words of the priests, the spirits of the offerings became
available as the food of the dead. Many prayers contain
requests for the things that tend to the comfort and general
well-being of the dead, but here and there we find a prayer
for forgiveness of sins committed in the body. The best
example of such is the prayer that forms Chapter CXXVI.
It reads: "Hail, ye four Ape-gods who sit in the bows of
the Boat of R&#257;, who convey truth to Nebertchet, who sit
in judgment on my weakness and on my strength, who make
the gods to rest contented by means of the flame of your
mouths, who offer holy offerings to the gods, and sepulchral
meals to the spirit-souls, who live upon truth, who feed
upon truth of heart, who are without deceit and fraud, and
to whom wickedness is an abomination, do ye away with
my evil deeds, and put ye away my sin, which deserved
stripes upon earth, and destroy ye every evil thing whatsoever
that clingeth to me, and let there be no bar whatsoever
on my part towards you. Grant ye that I may make
my way through the Amhet<a name="FNanchor_1_70" id="FNanchor_1_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_70" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> chamber, let me enter into
Rastau,<a name="FNanchor_2_71" id="FNanchor_2_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_71" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and let me pass through the secret places of
Amentet. Grant that cakes, and ale, and sweetmeats may
be given to me as they are given to the spirit-souls, and
grant that I may enter in and come forth from Rastau."
The four Ape-gods reply: "Come, for we have done away
with thy wickedness, and we have put away thy sin, which
deserved stripes, which thou didst commit upon earth, and
we have destroyed all the evil that clung to thee. Enter,
therefore, into Rastau, and pass in through the secret gates
of Amentet, and cakes, and ale, and sweetmeats shall be
given unto thee, and thou shalt go in and come out at thy
desire, even as do those whose spirit-souls are praised [by
the god], and [thy name] shall be proclaimed each day in the
horizon."</p>

<p>Another prayer of special interest is that which forms
Chapter XXXB. This is put into the mouth of the deceased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_50" id="Pg_50" title="Pg_50">[50]</a></span>when he is standing in the Hall of Judgment watching the
weighing of his heart in the Great Scales by Anubis and
Thoth, in the presence of the Great Company of the gods
and Osiris. He says: "My heart, my mother. My heart,
my mother. My heart whereby I came into being. Let
none stand up to oppose me at my judgment. May there
be no opposition to me in the presence of the Tchatchau.<a name="FNanchor_1_72" id="FNanchor_1_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_72" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Mayest thou not be separated from me in the presence of
the Keeper of the Balance. Thou art my Ka (<i>i.e.</i> Double,
or vital power), that dwelleth in my body; the god Khnemu
who knitteth together and strengthened my limbs. Mayest
thou come forth into the place of happiness whither we go.
May the Shenit officers who decide the destinies of the lives
of men not cause my name to stink [before Osiris]. Let
it (<i>i.e.</i> the weighing) be satisfactory unto us, and let there
be joy of heart to us at the weighing of words (<i>i.e.</i> the Great
Judgment). Let not that which is false be uttered against
me before the Great God, the Lord of Amentet (<i>i.e.</i> Osiris).
Verily thou shalt be great when thou risest up [having been
declared] a speaker of the truth."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_72" id="Footnote_1_72"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_72"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The chief officers of Osiris, the divine Taskmasters.</p></div>

<p>In many papyri this prayer is followed by a Rubric, which
orders that it is to be said over a green stone scarab set in a
band of <i>tchamu</i> metal (<i>i.e.</i> silver-gold), which is to be hung
by a ring from the neck of the deceased. Some Rubrics
order it to be placed in the breast of a mummy, where it is
to take the place of the heart, and say that it will "open
the mouth" of the deceased. A tradition which is as old
as the twelfth dynasty says that the Chapter was discovered
in the town of Khemenu (Hermopolis Magna) by Herutataf,
the son of Khufu, in the reign of Menkaur&#257;, a king of the
fourth dynasty. It was cut in hieroglyphs, inlaid with
lapis-lazuli on a block of alabaster, which was set under the
feet of Thoth, and was therefore believed to be a most powerful
prayer. We know that this prayer was recited by the
Egyptians in the Ptolemaic Period, and thus it is clear that
it was in common use for a period of nearly four thousand
years. It may well be the oldest prayer in the world.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_51" id="Pg_51" title="Pg_51">[51]</a></span>Under the Middle and New Empires this prayer was cut
upon hard green stone scarabs, but the versions of it
found on scarabs are often incomplete and full of mistakes.
It is quite clear that the prayer was turned into a spell,
and that it was used merely as a "word of power,"
and that the hard stone scarabs were regarded merely as
amulets. On many of them spaces are found that have
been left blank to receive the names of those with whom
they were to be buried; this proves that such scarabs
once formed part of some undertaker's stock-in-trade,
and that they were kept ready for those who were obliged
to buy "heart scarabs" in a hurry.</p>

<p>Another remarkable composition in the Book of the Dead
is the first part of Chapter CXXV, which well illustrates the
lofty moral conceptions of the Egyptians of the eighteenth
dynasty. The deceased is supposed to be standing in the
"Usekht Ma&#257;ti," or Hall of the Two Ma&#257;ti goddesses,
one for Upper Egypt and one for Lower Egypt, wherein
Osiris and his Forty-two Judges judge the souls of the
dead. Before judgment is given the deceased is allowed to
make a declaration, which in form closely resembles that
made in many parts of Africa at the present day by a man
who is condemned to undergo the ordeal of drinking "red
water," and in it he states that he has not committed offences
against the moral and religious laws of his country. He
says:</p>

<p>"Homage to thee, O Great God, thou Lord of Ma&#257;ti. I
have come to thee, O my Lord, and I have brought myself
hither that I may behold thy beauties. I know thee. I
know thy name. I know the names of the Forty-two<a name="FNanchor_1_73" id="FNanchor_1_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_73" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> gods
who live with thee in this Hall of Truth, who keep ward
over sinners, and who feed upon their blood on the day when
the lives of men are taken into account in the presence of
Un-Nefer (<i>i.e.</i> the Good Being or Osiris).... Verily, I have
come unto thee, I have brought truth unto thee. I have destroyed
wickedness for thee. I have not done evil to men.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_52" id="Pg_52" title="Pg_52">[52]</a></span>I have not oppressed (or wronged) my family. I have not
done wrong instead of right. I have not been a friend of
worthless men. I have not wrought evil. I have not tried
to make myself over-righteous. I have not put forward
my name for exalted positions. I have not entreated servants
evilly. I have not defrauded the man who was in
trouble. I have not done what is hateful (or taboo) to the
gods. I have not caused a servant to be ill-treated by his
master. I have not caused pain [to any man]. I have not
permitted any man to go hungry. I have made none to
weep. I have not committed murder. I have not ordered
any man to commit murder for me. I have inflicted pain
on no man. I have not robbed the temples of their offerings.
I have not stolen the cakes of the gods. I have not carried
off the cakes offered to the spirits. I have not committed
fornication. I have not committed acts of impurity in the
holy places of the god of my town. I have not diminished
the bushel. I have not added to or filched away land. I
have not encroached upon the fields [of my neighbours].
I have not added to the weights of the scales. I have not
falsified the pointer of the scales. I have not taken milk
from the mouths of children. I have not driven away the
cattle that were upon their pastures. I have not snared the
feathered fowl in the preserves of the gods. I have not
caught fish [with bait made of] fish of their kind. I have
not stopped water at the time [when it should flow]. I have
not breached a canal of running water. I have not extinguished
a fire when it should burn. I have not violated
the times [of offering] chosen meat-offerings. I have not
driven off the cattle from the property of the gods. I have
not repulsed the god in his manifestations. I am pure. I
am pure. I am pure. I am pure."</p>

<p>In the second part of the Chapter the deceased repeats
many of the above declarations of his innocence, but with
each declaration the name of one of the Forty-two Judges
is coupled. Thus we have:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. "Hail, thou of the long strides, who comest forth from
Heliopolis, I have not committed sin.</p>

<p>2. "Hail, thou who art embraced by flame, who comest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_53" id="Pg_53" title="Pg_53">[53]</a></span>
forth from Kher&#257;ha, I have not robbed with violence.</p>

<p>3. "Hail, Nose, who comest forth from Hermopolis, I
have not done violence [to any man].</p>

<p>4. "Hail, Eater of shadows, who comest forth from the
Qerti, I have not thieved.</p>

<p>5. "Hail, Stinking Face, who comest forth from Rastau,
I have not slain man or woman.</p>

<p>9. "Hail, Crusher of bones, who comest forth from Hensu,
I have not lied."</p>
</div>

<p>Nothing is known of the greater number of these Forty-two
gods, but it is probable that they were local gods or
spirits, each one representing a nome, whose names were
added to the declarations with the view of making the Forty-two
Judges represent all Egypt.</p>

<p>In the third part of the Chapter we find that the religious
ideas expressed by the deceased have a far more personal
character than those of the first and second parts. Thus,
having declared his innocence of the forty-two sins or offences,
"the heart which is righteous and sinless" says:</p>

<p>"Homage to you, O ye gods who dwell in your Hall of
Ma&#257;ti! I know you and I know your names. Let me not
fall under your knives, and bring ye not before the god whom
ye follow my wickedness, and let not evil come upon me
through you. Declare ye me innocent in the presence of
Nebertcher,<a name="FNanchor_1_74" id="FNanchor_1_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_74" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> because I have done that which is right in
Tamera (Egypt), neither blaspheming God, nor imputing
evil (?) to the king in his day. Homage to you, O ye gods,
who live in your Hall of Ma&#257;ti, who have no taint of sin in
you, who live upon truth, who feed upon truth before Horus,
the dweller in his disk. Deliver me from Baba, who liveth
upon the entrails of the mighty ones, on the day of the Great
Judgment. Let me come to you, for I have not committed
offences [against you]; I have not done evil, I have not
borne false witness; therefore let nothing [evil] be done
unto me. I live upon truth. I feed upon truth. I have
performed the commandments of men, and the things which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_54" id="Pg_54" title="Pg_54">[54]</a></span>make the gods contented. I have made the god to be at
peace [with me by doing] that which is his will. I have
given bread to the hungry man, and water to the thirsty
man, and apparel to the naked man, and a ferry boat to
him that had none. I have made offerings to the gods, and
given funerary meals to the spirits. Therefore be ye my
deliverers, be ye my protectors; make ye no accusations
against me in the presence [of the Great God]. I am clean
of mouth and clean of hands; therefore let be said unto
me by those who shall see me: 'Come in peace, come in
peace' (<i>i.e.</i> Welcome! Welcome!).... I have testified
before Herfhaf,<a name="FNanchor_2_75" id="FNanchor_2_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_75" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and he hath approved me. I have seen
the things over which the Persea tree spreadeth [its branches]
in Rastau. I offer up my prayers to the gods, and I know
their persons. I have come and have advanced to declare
the truth and to set up the Balance<a name="FNanchor_3_76" id="FNanchor_3_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_76" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> on its stand in Aukert."<a name="FNanchor_4_77" id="FNanchor_4_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_77" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Then addressing the god Osiris the deceased says: "Hail,
thou who art exalted upon thy standard, thou lord of the
Atef crown, whose name is 'Lord of the Winds,' deliver me
from thine envoys who inflict evils, who do harm, whose
faces are uncovered, for I have done the right for the Lord
of Truth. I have purified myself and my fore parts with
holy water, and my hinder parts with the things that make
clean, and my inward parts have been [immersed] in the
Lake of Truth. There is not one member of mine wherein
truth is lacking. I purified myself in the Pool of the South.
I rested in the northern town in the Field of the Grasshoppers,
wherein the sailors of R&#257; bathe at the second hour
of the night and at the third hour of the day." One would
think that the moral worth of the deceased was such that
he might then pass without delay into the most holy part
of the Hall of Truth where Osiris was enthroned. But this
is not the case, for before he went further he was obliged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_55" id="Pg_55" title="Pg_55">[55]</a></span>to repeat the magical names of various parts of the Hall
of Truth; thus we find that the priest thrust his magic
into the most sacred of texts. At length Thoth, the great
Recorder of Egypt, being satisfied as to the good faith and
veracity of the deceased, came to him and asked why he
had come to the Hall of Truth, and the deceased replied that
he had come in order to be "mentioned" to the god. Thoth
then asked him, "Who is he whose heaven is fire, whose
walls are serpents, and the floor of whose house is a stream
of water?" The deceased replied, "Osiris"; and he was
then bidden to advance so that he might be introduced to
Osiris. As a reward for his righteous life sacred food, which
proceeded from the Eye of R&#257;, was allotted to him, and,
living on the food of the god, he became a counterpart of
the god.</p>

<p>From first to last the Book of the Dead is filled with spells
and prayers for the preservation of the mummy and for
everlasting life. As instances of these the following passages
are quoted from Chapters 154 and 175. "Homage to thee,
O my divine father Osiris, thou livest with thy members.
Thou didst not decay. Thou didst not turn into worms.
Thou didst not waste away. Thou didst not suffer corruption.
Thou didst not putrefy. I am the god Khepera, and
my members shall have an everlasting existence. I shall
not decay. I shall not rot. I shall not putrefy. I shall
not turn into worms. I shall not see corruption before the
eye of the god Shu. I shall have my being, I shall have
my being. I shall live, I shall live. I shall flourish, I shall
flourish. I shall wake up in peace. I shall not putrefy.
My inward parts shall not perish. I shall not suffer injury.
Mine eye shall not decay. The form of my visage shall not
disappear. Mine ear shall not become deaf. My head
shall not be separated from my neck. My tongue shall not
be carried away. My hair shall not be cut off. Mine eyebrows
shall not be shaved off. No baleful injury shall come
upon me. My body shall be established, and it shall neither
crumble away nor be destroyed on this earth." The passage
that refers to everlasting life occurs in Chapter 175, wherein
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_56" id="Pg_56" title="Pg_56">[56]</a></span>the scribe Ani is made to converse with Thoth and Temu
in the Tuat, or Other World. Ani, who is supposed to have
recently arrived there, says: "What manner of country is
this to which I have come? There is no water in it. There
is no air. It is depth unfathomable, it is black as the
blackest night, and men wander helplessly therein. In it a
man may not live in quietness of heart; nor may the
affections be gratified therein." After a short address
to Osiris, the deceased asks the god, "How long shall
I live?" And the god says, "It is decreed that thou shalt
live for millions of millions of years, a life of millions of
years."</p>

<p>As a specimen of a spell that was used in connection
with an amulet may be quoted Chapter 156. The amulet
was the <i>tet</i>, which represented a portion of the body of Isis.
The spell reads: "The blood of Isis, the power of Isis, the
words of power of Isis shall be strong to protect this mighty
one (<i>i.e.</i> the mummy), and to guard him from him that would
do unto him anything which he abominateth (or, is taboo to
him)." The object of the spell is explained in the Rubric,
which reads: "[This spell] shall be said over a <i>tet</i> made of
carnelian, which hath been steeped in water of <i>ankham</i>
flowers, and set in a frame of sycamore wood, and placed
on the neck of the deceased on the day of the funeral. If
these things be done for him the powers of Isis shall protect
his body, and Horus, the son of Isis, shall rejoice in him when
he seeth him. And there shall be no places hidden from him
as he journeyeth. And one hand of his shall be towards
heaven and the other towards earth, regularly and continually.
Thou shalt not let any person who is with thee see it
[a few words broken away]." Of the spells written in the
Book of the Dead to make crocodiles, serpents, and other
reptiles powerless, the following are specimens: "Away
with thee! Retreat! Get back, O thou accursed Crocodile
Sui. Thou shalt not come nigh me, for I have life through
the words of power that are in me. If I utter thy name to
the Great God he will make thee to come before the two
divine messengers Betti and Herkemma&#257;t. Heaven ruleth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_57" id="Pg_57" title="Pg_57">[57]</a></span>its seasons, and the spell hath power over what it mastereth,
and my mouth ruleth the spell that is inside it. My teeth
which bite are like flint knives, and my teeth which grind
are like unto those of the Wolf-god. O thou who sittest
spellbound with thine eyes fixed through my spell, thou
shalt not carry off my spell, thou Crocodile that livest on
spells" (Chap. XXXI).</p>

<h3>BOOKS OF THE DEAD OF THE <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'GRAECO'.">GR&AElig;CO</ins>-ROMAN PERIOD<br /><br /></h3>


<p>From what has been said in the preceding chapter it will be
clear that only wealthy people could afford to bury copies
of the great Book of the Dead with their deceased relatives.
Whether the chapters that formed it were written on coffins
or on papyrus the cost of copying the work by a competent
scribe must have been relatively very great. Towards the
close of the twenty-sixth dynasty a feeling spread among
the Egyptians that only certain parts of the Book of the Dead
were essential for the resurrection of the body and for the
salvation of the soul, and men began to bury with their dead
copies of the most important chapters of it in a very much
abridged form. A little later the scribes produced a number
of works, in which they included only such portions of the
most important chapters as were considered necessary to
effect the resurrection of the body. In other words, they
rejected all the old magical elements in the Book of the Dead,
and preserved only the texts and formul&aelig; that appertained
to the cult of Osiris, the first man who had risen from the
dead. One of the oldest of these later substitutes for the
Book of the Dead is the <i>Shai en Sensen</i>, or "<b>Book of Breathings</b>."
Several copies of this work are extant in the funerary
papyri, and the following sections, translated from a papyrus
in the British Museum, will give an idea of the character of
the Book:</p>

<p>"Hail, Osiris<a name="FNanchor_1_82" id="FNanchor_1_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_82" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Kersher, son of Tashenatit! Thou art
pure, thy heart is pure. Thy fore parts are pure, thy hind
parts are cleansed; thy interior is cleansed with incense and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_60" id="Pg_60" title="Pg_60">[60]</a></span>natron, and no member of thine hath any defect in it whatsoever.
Kersher is washed in the waters of the Field of
Offerings, that lieth to the north of the Field of the Grasshoppers.
The goddesses Uatchet and Nekhebet purify thee at
the eighth hour of the night and at the eighth hour of the day.
Come then, enter the Hall of Truth, for thou art free from
all offence and from every defect, and 'Stone of Truth' is
thy name. Thou enterest the Tuat (Other World) as one
exceedingly pure. Thou art purified by the Goddesses of
Truth in the Great Hall. Holy water hath been poured
over thee in the Hall of Keb (<i>i.e.</i> the earth), and thy body
hath been made pure in the Hall of Shu (heaven). Thou
lookest upon R&#257; when he setteth in the form of Tem at
eventide. Amen is nigh unto thee and giveth thee air, and
Ptah likewise, who fashioned thy members for thee; thou
enterest the horizon with R&#257;. Thy soul is received in the
Neshem Boat of Osiris, thy soul is made divine in the House
of Keb, and thou art made to be triumphant for ever and
ever."</p>

<p>"Hail, Osiris Kersher! Thy name flourisheth, thy earthly
body is stablished, thy spirit body germinateth, and thou
art not repulsed either in heaven or on earth. Thy face
shineth before R&#257;, thy soul liveth before Amen, and thy
earthly body is renewed before Osiris. Thou breathest the
breath of life for ever and ever. Thy soul maketh offerings
unto thee in the course of each day.... Thy flesh is collected
on thy bones, and thy form is even as it was upon
earth. Thou takest drink into thy body, thou eatest with
thy mouth, and thou receivest thy rations in company with
the souls of the gods. Anubis protecteth thee; he is thy
protector, and thou art not turned away from the Gates of
the Tuat. Thoth, the most mighty god, the Lord of Khemenu
(Hermopolis), cometh to thee, and he writeth the
'Book of Breathings' with his own fingers. Then doth thy
soul breathe for ever and ever, and thy form is renewed with
life upon earth; thou art made divine with the souls of the
gods, thy heart is the heart of R&#257;, and thy limbs are the
limbs of the great god. Amen is nigh unto thee to make thee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_61" id="Pg_61" title="Pg_61">[61]</a></span>to live again. Upuat openeth a prosperous road for thee.
Thou seest with thine eyes, thou hearest with thine ears,
thou speakest with thy mouth, thou walkest with thy legs.
Thy soul hath been made divine in the Tuat, so that it may
change itself into any form it pleaseth. Thou canst snuff at
will the odours of the holy Acacia of Anu (An, or Heliopolis).
Thou wakest each day and seest the light of R&#257;; thou appearest
upon the earth each day, and the 'Book of Breathings'
of Thoth is thy protection, for through it dost thou draw thy
breath each day, and through it do thine eyes behold the
beams of the Sun-god Aten. The Goddess of Truth vindicateth
thee before Osiris, and her writings are upon thy tongue.
R&#257; vivifieth thy soul, the Soul of Shu is in thy nostrils. Thou
art even as Osiris, and 'Osiris Khenti Amenti' is thy name.
Thy body liveth in Tatu (Busiris), and thy soul liveth in
heaven.... Thy odour is that of the holy gods in Amentet,
and thy name is magnified like the names of the Spirits of
heaven. Thy soul liveth through the 'Book of Breathings,'
and it is rejoined to thy body by the 'Book of Breathings.'
These fine extracts are followed in the British Museum
papyrus by the praises of Kersher by the gods, a prayer of
Kersher himself for offerings, and an extract from the so-called
Negative Confession, which has been already described.
The work is closed by an address to the gods, in which it is
said that Kersher is sinless, that he feeds and lives upon
Truth, that his deeds have satisfied the hearts of the gods,
and that he has fed the hungry and given water to the thirsty
and clothes to the naked.<a name="FNanchor_2_83" id="FNanchor_2_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_83" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_82" id="Footnote_1_82"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_82"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The deceased is always supposed to be identified with Osiris.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_83" id="Footnote_2_83"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_83"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> A papyrus at Florence contains a copy of Part II. of The Book of
Breathings. The fundamental ideas are the same as those in Part I., but the
forms in which they are expressed are different. The deceased is made to
address several gods by name, and to declare that he himself is those gods.
"I am R&#257;, I am Atem, I am Osiris, I am Horus, I am Thoth," &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>Another late work of considerable interest is the "<b>Book
of Traversing Eternity</b>," the fullest known form of which is
found on a papyrus at Vienna. This work describes how
the soul of the deceased, when armed with the power which
the Book of Traversing Eternity will give it, shall be able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_62" id="Pg_62" title="Pg_62">[62]</a></span>travel from one end of Egypt to the other, and to visit all
the holy places, and to assist at the festivals, and to enjoy
communion not only with the gods and spirits who assemble
there, but also with its kinsfolk and acquaintances whom it
left behind alive on the earth. The object of the book was
to secure for the deceased the resurrection of his body; it
opens with the following words: "Thy soul liveth in heaven
in the presence of R&#257;. Thy Ka hath acquired the divine
nature of the gods. Thy body remaineth in the deep house
(<i>i.e.</i> tomb) in the presence of Osiris. Thy spirit-body becometh
glorious among the living. Thy descendants flourish
upon the earth, in the presence of Keb, upon thy seat among
the living, and thy name is stablished by the utterance of
those who have their being through the 'Book of Traversing
Eternity.' Thou comest forth by day, thou art joined to
the Sun-god Aten." The text goes on to state that the
deceased breathes, speaks, eats, drinks, sees, hears, and
walks, and that all the organs of his body are in their proper
places, and that each is performing its proper functions. He
floats in the air, hovers in the shadow, rises in the sky, follows
the gods, travels with the stars, dekans, and planets,
and moves about by night and by day on earth and in heaven
at will.</p>

<p>Of the works that were originally composed for recitation
on the days of the festivals of Osiris, and were specially connected
with the cult of this god, three, which became very
popular in the Graeco-Roman period, may be mentioned.
These are: (1) <b>The Lamentations of Isis and Nephthys</b>; (2)
The Festival Songs of Isis and Nephthys; (3) The Book of
making splendid the Spirit of Osiris. The first of these
works was recited on the twenty-fifth day of the fourth month
of the season Akhet (October-November) by two "fair
women," who personified Isis and Nephthys. One of these
had the name of Isis on her shoulder, and the other the name
of Nephthys, and each held a vessel of water in her right hand,
and a "Memphis cake of bread" in her left. The object of
the recital was to commemorate the resurrection of Osiris,
and if the book were recited on behalf of any deceased person
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_63" id="Pg_63" title="Pg_63">[63]</a></span>it would make his spirit to be glorious, and stablish his body,
and cause his Ka to rejoice, and give breath to his nostrils
and air to his throat. The two "fair women" sang the sections
alternately in the presence of the Kher-heb and Setem
priests. The two first sections, as they are found on a papyrus
in Berlin, read thus:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Isis saith</span>: "Come to thy house,
come to thy house, O An, come to thy house. Thine enemy
[Set] hath perished. O beautiful youth, come to thy house.
Look thou upon me. I am the sister who loveth thee, go
not far from me. O Beautiful Boy, come to thy house,
straightway, straightway. I cannot see thee, and my heart
weepeth for thee; my eyes follow thee about. I am following
thee about so that I may see thee. Lo, I wait to see thee,
I wait to see thee; behold, Prince, I wait to see thee. It is
good to see thee, it is good to see thee; O An, it is good to
see thee. Come to thy beloved one, come to thy beloved
one, O Un-Nefer, whose word is truth. Come to thy wife, O
thou whose heart is still. Come to the lady of thy house; I
am thy sister from thy mother's [womb]. Go not thou far
from me. The faces of gods and men are turned towards
thee, they all weep for thee together. As soon as I saw thee
I cried out to thee, weeping with a loud voice which pierced
the heavens, and thou didst not hear my voice. I am thy
sister who loved thee upon earth; none other loved thee
more than [thy] sister, thy sister."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nephthys saith</span>: "O Beautiful Prince, come to thy
house. Let thy heart rejoice and be glad, for thine enemies
have ceased to be. Thy two Sisters are nigh unto thee; they
guard thy bier, they address thee with words [full of] tears
as thou liest prone on thy bier. Look thou at the young
women; speak to us, O our Sovereign Lord. Destroy thou
all the misery that is in our hearts; the chiefs among gods
and men look upon thee. Turn thou towards us thy face,
O our Sovereign Lord. At the sight of thy face life cometh to
our faces; turn not thou thy face from us. The joy of our
heart is in the sight of thee. O Beautiful Sovereign, our
hearts would see thee. I am thy sister Nephthys who loveth
thee. The fiend Seba hath fallen, he hath not being. I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_64" id="Pg_64" title="Pg_64">[64]</a></span>with thee, and I act as the protectress of thy members for
ever and ever."</p>

<p>The second work, the "<b>Festival Songs of Isis and Nephthys</b>,"
was sung during the great festival of Osiris, which
took place in the fourth month of the Season of Akhet and
lasted five days (from the twenty-second to the twenty-sixth
day). It was sung by two virgins who wore fillets of sheep's
wool on their heads, and held tambourines in their hands;
one was called Isis and the other Nephthys. According to
the rubrical directions given in the British Museum papyrus,
the sections were sung by both women together. The following
passage will illustrate the contents of the work:</p>

<p>"Come, come, run to me, O strong heart! Let me see
thy divine face, for I do not see thee, and make thou clear
the path that we may see thee as we see R&#257; in heaven, when
the heavens unite with the earth, and cause darkness to fall
upon the earth each day. My heart burneth as with fire at
thy escape from the Fiend, even as my heart burneth with
fire when thou turnest thy side to me; O that thou wouldst
never remove it from me! O thou who unitest the Two
Domains (<i>i.e.</i> Egypt, North and South), and who turnest
back those who are on the roads, I seek to see thee because
of my love for thee.... Thou fliest like a living being, O
Everlasting King; thou hast destroyed the fiend Anrekh.
Thou art the King of the South and of the North, and thou
goest forth from Tatchesert. May there never be a moment
in thy life when I do not fill thy heart, O my divine brother,
my lord who goest forth from Aqert.... My arms are raised
to protect thee, O thou whom I love. I love thee, O Husband,
Brother, lord of love; come thou in peace into thy
house.... Thy hair is like turquoise as thou comest forth
from the Fields of Turquoise, thy hair is like unto the finest
lapis-lazuli, and thou thyself art more blue than thy hair.
Thy skin and body are like southern alabaster, and thy bones
are of silver. The perfume of thy hair is like unto new myrrh,
and thy skull is of lapis-lazuli."</p>

<p>The third work, "<b>The Book of making splendid the
Spirit of Osiris</b>," was also sung at the great festival of Osiris
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_65" id="Pg_65" title="Pg_65">[65]</a></span>that took place during the November-December at Abydos
and other great towns in Egypt, and if it were sung on behalf
of any man, the resurrection and life, constantly renewed,
of that man were secured for his soul and spirit. This Book,
written in hieratic, is found in a papyrus in Paris, and the
following extract will illustrate its contents: "Come to
thy house, come to thy house, O An. Come to thy house,
O Beautiful Bull, lord of men and women, the beloved one,
the lord of women. O Beautiful Face, Chief of Akert, Prince,
Khenti Amentiu, are not all hearts drunk through the love
of thee, O Un-Nefer, whose word is truth? The hands of
men and gods are lifted up and seek thee, even as the hands
of a babe are stretched out to his mother. Come thou to
them, for their hearts are sad, and make them to rejoice.
The lands of Horus exult, the domains of Set are overthrown
because of their fear of thee. Hail, Osiris Khenti Amentiu!
I am thy sister Isis. No god and no goddess have done for
thee what I have done. I, a woman, made a man child for
thee, because of my desire to make thy name to live upon
the earth. Thy divine essence was in my body, I brought
him forth on the ground. He pleaded thy case, he healed
thy suffering, he decreed the destruction of him that caused
it. Set fell under his knife, and the Smamiu fiends of Set
followed him. The throne of the Earth-god is thine, O thou
who art his beloved son.... There is health in thy members,
thy wounds are healed, thy sufferings are relieved, thou
shalt never groan again in pain. Come to us thy sisters,
come to us; our hearts will live when thou comest. Men
shall cry out to thee, and women shall weep glad tears, at
thy coming to them.... The Nile appeareth at the command
of thy mouth; thou makest men to live on the effluxes
that proceed from thy members, and thou makest every
field to flourish. When thou comest that which is dead
springeth into life, and the plants in the marshes put forth
blossoms. Thou art the Lord of millions of years, the sustainer
of wild creatures, and the lord of cattle; every created
thing hath its existence from thee. What is in the earth is
thine. What is in the heavens is thine. What is in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_66" id="Pg_66" title="Pg_66">[66]</a></span>waters is thine. Thou art the Lord of Truth, the hater of
sinners, whom thou overthrowest in their sins. The Goddesses
of Truth are with thee; they never leave thee. No
sinful man can approach thee in the place where thou art.
Whatsoever appertaineth to life and to death belongeth to
thee, and to thee belongeth everything that concerneth man."</p>

<p>During the period of the occupation of Egypt by the
Romans, the three last-named works were still further
abridged, and eventually the texts that were considered
essential for salvation were written upon small sheets of
papyrus from 9 to 12 inches high, and from 5 to 10 inches
wide.<br /></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE EGYPTIAN STORY OF THE CREATION<br /><br /></h3>


<p>If we consider for a moment the vast amount of thought
which the Egyptian gave to the problems of the future life,
and their deep-seated belief in resurrection and immortality,
we cannot fail to conclude that he must have theorised
deeply about the constitution of the heaven in which he
hoped to live everlastingly, and about its Maker. The
translations given in the preceding pages prove that the
theologians of Egypt were ready enough to describe heaven,
and the life led by the blessed there, and the powers and the
attributes of the gods, but they appear to have shrunk from
writing down in a connected form their beliefs concerning
the Creation and the origin of the Creator. The worshippers
of each great god proclaimed him to be the Creator of All,
and every great town had its own local belief on the subject.
According to the Heliopolitans, Atem, or Tem, and at a later
period R&#257;, was the Creator; according to Memphite theology
he was Ptah; according to the Hermopolitans he was Thoth;
and according to the Thebans he was Amen (Ammon). In
only one native Egyptian work up to the present has there
been discovered any connected account of the Creation, and
the means by which it was effected, namely, the British
Museum Papyrus, No. 10,188. This papyrus was written
about 305 B.C., and is therefore of a comparatively late date,
but the subject matter of the works contained in it is thousands
of years older, and it is only <i>their</i> forms which are of a
late date. The Story of the Creation is found in the last
work in the papyrus, which is called the "Book of overthrowing
&#256;apep, the Enemy of R&#257;, the Enemy of Un-Nefer"
(<i>i.e.</i> Osiris). This work is a liturgy, which was said at certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_68" id="Pg_68" title="Pg_68">[68]</a></span>times of the day and night in the great temple of Amen-R&#257;
at Thebes, with the view of preventing the monster &#256;apep
from obstructing the sunrise. &#256;apep was supposed to lie
in wait for the sun daily just before sunrise, with the view of
doing battle with him and overthrowing him. When the
Sun-god arrived at the place where &#256;apep was, he first of all
cast a spell upon the monster, which rendered him helpless,
and then he cast his fiery rays upon him, which shrivelled
him up, and the fire of the god consumed him entirely. In
the temple of Amen-R&#257; the priests recited the spells that
were supposed to help the Sun-god to burn up &#256;apep, and
they burnt waxen figures of the monster in specially prepared
fires, and, uttering curses, they trampled them under foot
and defiled them. These spells and burnings were also believed
to break up rain clouds, and to scatter fog and mist
and to dissipate thunder-storms, and to help the sun to rise
on this world in a cloudless sky. &#256;apep was a form of
Set, the god of evil of every kind, and his allies were the
"Red Fiends" and the "Black Fiends," and every power
of darkness. In the midst of the magical spells of this papyrus
we find two copies of the "Book of knowing how R&#257;
came into being, and of overthrowing &#256;apep." One copy
is a little fuller than the other, but they agree substantially.
The words of this book are said in the opening line to have
been spoken by the god Nebertcher, <i>i.e.</i> the "Lord to the
uttermost limit," or God Himself. The Egyptian Christians,
or Copts, in their religious writings use this name as an
equivalent of God Almighty, the Lord of All, the God of the
Universe. Nebertcher says: "I am the creator of what
hath come into being. I myself came into being under the
form of the god Khepera. I came into being under the form
of Pautti (or, in primeval time), I formed myself out of the
primeval matter, I made myself out of the substance that
was in primeval time."<a name="FNanchor_1_84" id="FNanchor_1_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_84" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Nothing existed at that time except
the great primeval watery mass called <span class="smcap">Nu</span>, but in this
there were the germs of everything that came into being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_69" id="Pg_69" title="Pg_69">[69]</a></span>subsequently. There was no heaven, and no earth, and
the god found no place on which to stand; nothing, in fact,
existed except the god. He says, "I was alone." He
first created himself by uttering his own name as a word of
power, and when this was uttered his visible form appeared.
He then uttered another kind of word of power, and as a
result of this his soul (<i>ba</i>) came into being, and it worked in
connection with his heart or mind (<i>ab</i>). Before every act of
creation Nebertcher, or his visible form Khepera, thought
out what form the thing to be created was to take, and when
he had uttered its name the thing itself appeared in heaven
or earth. To fill the heaven, or place where he lived, the god
next produced from his body and its shadow the two gods
Shu and Tefnut. These with Nebertcher, or Khepera,
formed the first triad of gods, and the "one god became
three," or, as we should say, the one god had three aspects,
each of which was quite distinct from the other. The
tradition of the begetting of Shu and Tefnut is as old as the
time of the pyramids, for it is mentioned in the text of Pepi I,
l. 466. The next act of creation resulted in the emerging of
the Eye of Nebertcher (later identified with R&#257;) from the
watery mass (<span class="smcap">Nu</span>), and light shone upon its waters. Shu
and Tefnut then united and they produced Keb, the Earth-god,
and Nut, the Sky-goddess. The text then refers to
some calamity which befell the Eye of Nebertcher or of
Khepera, but what it was is not clear; at all events the Eye
became obscured, and it ceased to give light. This period
of darkness is, of course, the night, and to obviate the inconvenience
caused by this recurring period of darkness, the
god made a second Eye, <i>i.e.</i> the Moon, and set it in the
heavens. The greater Eye ruled the day, and the lesser Eye
the night. One of the results of the daily darkness was the
descent of the Sky-goddess Nut to the Earth-god Keb each
evening.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_84" id="Footnote_1_84"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_84"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The second version here states that the name of Nebertcher is Ausares
(Osiris), who is the oldest god of all.</p></div>

<p>The gods and goddesses next created were five, namely,
Osiris, Horus, Set, Isis, and Nephthys. Osiris married
Isis, and their son was called Horus; Set married Nephthys,
but their son Anpu, or Anubis, is not mentioned in our text.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_70" id="Pg_70" title="Pg_70">[70]</a></span>Osiris became the great Ancestor-god of Egypt, and was a
reincarnation of his great-grandfather. Men and women
were first formed from the tears that fell from the Eye of
Khepera, or the Sun-god, upon his body; the old Egyptian
word for "men" very closely resembles in form and sound
the word for "tears." Plants, vegetables, herbs, and trees
owe their origin to the light of the moon falling upon the
earth. Our text contains no mention of a special creation
of the "beasts of the field," but the god states distinctly
that he created the children of the earth, or creeping things
of all kinds, and among this class quadrupeds are probably
included. The men and women, and all the other living
creatures that were made at that time by Nebertcher, or
Khepera, reproduced their species, each in his own way,
and thus the earth became filled with their descendants as
we see at the present time. The elements of this Creation
legend are very, very old, and the form in which they are
grouped in our text suggests the influence of the priests of
Heliopolis. It is interesting to note that only very ancient
gods appear as Powers of creation, and these were certainly
worshipped for many centuries before the priests of Heliopolis
invented their cult of the Sun-god, and identified their
god with the older gods of the country. We may note, too,
that gods like Ptah and Amen, whose reputation was so great
in later times, and even when our text was copied in 305 B.C.,
find no mention at all.<br /></p>

<h3>LEGENDS OF THE GODS<br /><br /></h3>


<p>The Egyptians believed that at one time all the great gods
and goddesses lived upon earth, and that they ruled Egypt
in much the same way as the Pharaohs with whom they were
more or less acquainted. They went about among men and
took a real personal interest in their affairs, and, according
to tradition, they spared no pains in promoting their
wishes and well-being. Their rule was on the whole beneficent,
chiefly because in addition to their divine attributes
they possessed natures, and apparently bodily constitutions
that were similar to those of men. Like men also they
were supposed to feel emotions and passions, and to be
liable to the accidents that befell men, and to grow old, and
even to die. The greatest of all the gods was R&#257;, and he
reigned over Egypt for very many years. His reign was
marked by justice and righteousness, and he was in all
periods of Egyptian history regarded as the type of what a
king should be. When men instead of gods reigned over
Egypt they all delighted to call themselves sons of R&#257;, and
every king believed that R&#257; was his true father, and regarded
his mother's husband as his father only in name. This
belief was always common in Egypt, and even Alexander the
Great found it expedient to adopt it, for he made a journey
to the sanctuary of Amen (Ammon) in the Oasis of S&#299;w&#257;h
in order to be officially acknowledged by the god. Having
obtained this recognition, he became the rightful lord of
Egypt.<br /><br /></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Destruction of Mankind</span></h3>

<p>This Legend is cut in hieroglyphs on the walls of a small
chamber in the tomb of Seti I about 1350 B.C. When R&#257;,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_72" id="Pg_72" title="Pg_72">[72]</a></span>the self-begotten and self-formed god, had been ruling gods
and men for some time, men began to complain about him,
saying, "His Majesty hath become old. His bones have
turned into silver, his flesh into gold, and his hair into real
lapis-lazuli." His Majesty heard these murmurings and commanded
his followers to summon to his presence his Eye
(<i>i.e.</i> the goddess Hathor), Shu, Tefnut, Keb, Nut, and the
father and mother gods and goddesses who were with him
in the watery abyss of <span class="smcap">Nu</span>, and also the god of this water, <span class="smcap">Nu</span>.
They were to come to him with all their followers secretly,
so that men should not suspect the reason for their coming,
and take flight, and they were to assemble in the Great House
in Heliopolis, where R&#257; would take counsel with them. In
due course all the gods assembled in the Great House, and
they ranged themselves down the sides of the House, and
they bowed down in homage before R&#257; until their heads
touched the ground, and said, "Speak, for we are listening."
Then R&#257; addresing Nu, the father of the first-born gods,
told him to give heed to what men were doing, for they whom
he had created were murmuring against him. And he said,
"Tell me what ye would do. Consider the matter, invent a
plan for me, and I will not slay them until I have heard what
ye shall say concerning this thing." Nu replied, "Thou,
O my son R&#257;, art greater than the god who made thee (<i>i.e.</i>
Nu himself), thou art the king of those who were created
with thee, thy throne is established, and the fear of thee is
great. Let thine Eye (Hathor) attack those who blaspheme
thee." And R&#257; said, "Lo, they have fled to the mountains,
for their hearts are afraid because of what they have said."
The gods replied, "Let thine Eye go forth and destroy those
who blasphemed thee, for no eye can resist thine when it
goeth forth in the form of Hathor." Thereupon the Eye of
R&#257;, or Hathor, went in pursuit of the blasphemers in the
mountains, and slew them all. On her return R&#257; welcomed
her, and the goddess said that the work of vanquishing men
was dear to her heart. R&#257; then said that he would be the
master of men as their king, and that he would destroy them.
For three nights the goddess Hathor-Sekhmet waded about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_73" id="Pg_73" title="Pg_73">[73]</a></span>in the blood of men, the slaughter beginning at Hensu (Herakleopolis
Magna).</p>

<p>Then the Majesty of R&#257; ordered that messengers should
be sent to Abu, a town at the foot of the First Cataract, to
fetch mandrakes (?), and when they were brought he gave
them to the god Sekti to crush. When the women slaves
were bruising grain for making beer, the crushed mandrakes (?)
were placed in the vessels that were to hold the beer, together
with some of the blood of those who had been slain by Hathor.
The beer was then made, and seven thousand vessels were
filled with it. When R&#257; saw the beer he ordered it to be
taken to the scene of slaughter, and poured out on the
meadows of the four quarters of heaven. The object of
putting mandrakes (?) in the beer was to make those who
drank fall asleep quickly, and when the goddess Hathor
came and drank the beer mixed with blood and mandrakes (?)
she became very merry, and, the sleepy stage of drunkenness
coming on her, she forgot all about men, and slew no more.
At every festival of Hathor ever after "sleepy beer" was
made, and it was drunk by those who celebrated the feast.</p>

<p>Now, although the blasphemers of R&#257; had been put to
death, the heart of the god was not satisfied, and he complained
to the gods that he was smitten with the "pain of
the fire of sickness." He said, "My heart is weary because
I have to live with men; I have slain some of them, but
worthless men still live, and I did not slay as many as I
ought to have done considering my power." To this the
gods replied, "Trouble not about thy lack of action, for thy
power is in proportion to thy will." Here the text becomes
fragmentary, but it seems that the goddess Nut took the form
of a cow, and that the other gods lifted R&#257; on to her back.
When men saw that R&#257; was leaving the earth, they repented
of their murmurings, and the next morning they went out
with bows and arrows to fight the enemies of the Sun-god.
As a reward for this R&#257; forgave those men their former
blasphemies, but persisted in his intention of retiring from
the earth. He ascended into the heights of heaven, being
still on the back of the Cow-goddess Nut, and he created
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_74" id="Pg_74" title="Pg_74">[74]</a></span>there Sekhet-hetep and Sekhet-Aaru as abodes for the blessed,
and the flowers that blossomed therein he turned into stars.
He also created the millions of beings who lived there in
order that they might praise him. The height to which R&#257;
had ascended was now so great that the legs of the Cow-goddess
on which he was enthroned trembled, and to give her strength
he ordained that Nut should be held up in her position by
the godhead and upraised arms of the god Shu. This is
why we see pictures of the body of Nut being supported by
Shu. The legs of the Cow-goddess were supported by the
various gods, and thus the seat of the throne of R&#257; became
stable. When this was done R&#257; caused the Earth-god Keb
to be summoned to his presence, and when he came he spake
to him about the venomous reptiles that lived in the earth
and were hostile to him. Then turning to Thoth, he bade
him to prepare a series of spells and words of power, which
would enable those who knew them to overcome snakes and
serpents and deadly reptiles of all kinds. Thoth did so,
and the spells which he wrote under the direction of R&#257;
served as a protection of the servants of R&#257; ever after, and
secured for them the help of Keb, who became sole lord of
all the beings that lived and moved on and in his body, the
earth. Before finally relinquishing his active rule on earth,
R&#257; summoned Thoth and told him of his desire to create a
Light-soul in the Tuat and in the Land of the Caves. Over
this region he appointed Thoth to rule, and he ordered him
to keep a register of those who were there, and to mete out
just punishments to them. In fact, Thoth was to be ever
after the representative of R&#257; in the Other World.<br /><br /></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Legend of R&#257; and Isis</span></h3>

<p>This Legend is found written in the hieratic character upon
a papyrus preserved in Turin, and it illustrates a portion of
the preceding Legend. We have seen that R&#257; instructed
Thoth to draw up a series of spells to be used against venomous
reptiles of all kinds, and the reader will perceive from
the following summary that R&#257; had good reason for doing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_75" id="Pg_75" title="Pg_75">[75]</a></span>this. The Legend opens with a list of the titles of R&#257;, the
"self-created god," creator of heaven, earth, breath of life,
fire, gods, men, beasts, cattle, reptiles, feathered fowl, and
fish, the King of gods and men, to whom cycles of 120 years
are as years, whose manifold names are unknown even by the
gods. The text continues: "Isis had the form of a woman,
and knew words of power, but she was disgusted with men,
and she yearned for the companionship of the gods and the
spirits, and she meditated and asked herself whether, supposing
she had the knowledge of the Name of R&#257;, it was
not possible to make herself as great as R&#257; was in heaven
and on the earth? Meanwhile R&#257; appeared in heaven each
day upon his throne, but he had become old, and he dribbled
at the mouth, and his spittle fell on the ground. One day
Isis took some of the spittle and kneaded up dust in it, and
made this paste into the form of a serpent with a forked
tongue, so that if it struck anyone the person struck would
find it impossible to escape death. This figure she placed
on the path on which R&#257; walked as he came into heaven
after his daily survey of the Two Lands (<i>i.e.</i> Egypt). Soon
after this R&#257; rose up, and attended by his gods he came into
heaven, but as he went along the serpent drove its fangs into
him. As soon as he was bitten R&#257; felt the living fire leaving
his body, and he cried out so loudly that his voice reached
the uttermost parts of heaven. The gods rushed to him in
great alarm, saying, "What is the matter?" At first R&#257;
was speechless, and found himself unable to answer, for his
jaws shook, his lips trembled, and the poison continued to
run through every part of his body. When he was able to
regain a little strength, he told the gods that some deadly
creature had bitten him, something the like of which he had
never seen, something which his hand had never made. He
said, "Never before have I felt such pain; there is no pain
worse than this." R&#257; then went on to describe his greatness
and power, and told the listening gods that his father and
mother had hidden his name in his body so that no one might
be able to master him by means of any spell or word of power.
In spite of this something had struck him, and he knew not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_76" id="Pg_76" title="Pg_76">[76]</a></span>what it was. "Is it fire?" he asked. "Is it water? My
heart is full of burning fire, my limbs are shivering, shooting
pains are in all my members." All the gods round about
him uttered cries of lamentation, and at this moment Isis
appeared. Going to R&#257; she said, "What is this, O divine
father? What is this? Hath a serpent bitten thee? Hath
something made by thee lifted up its head against thee?
Verily my words of power shall overthrow it; I will make it
depart in the sight of thy light." R&#257; then repeated to Isis
the story of the incident, adding, "I am colder than water,
I am hotter than fire. All my members sweat. My body
quaketh. Mine eye is unsteady. I cannot look on the sky,
and my face is bedewed with water as in the time of the
Inundation."<a name="FNanchor_1_85" id="FNanchor_1_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_85" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Then Isis said, "Father, tell me thy name,
for he who can utter his own name liveth."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_85" id="Footnote_1_85"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_85"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <i>i.e.</i> in the period of summer. The season Shemmu began in April and
ended about July 15.</p></div>

<p>R&#257; replied, "I am the maker of heaven and earth. I
knit together the mountains and whatsoever liveth on them.
I made the waters. I made Mehturit<a name="FNanchor_1_86" id="FNanchor_1_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_86" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to come into being.
I made Kamutef.<a name="FNanchor_2_87" id="FNanchor_2_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_87" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> I made heaven, and the two hidden gods
of the horizon, and put souls into the gods. I open my eyes,
and there is light; I shut my eyes, and there is darkness.
I speak the word[s], and the waters of the Nile appear. I am
he whom the gods know not. I make the hours. I create
the days. I open the year. I make the river [Nile]. I
create the living fire whereby works in the foundries and workshops
are carried out. I am Khepera in the morning, R&#257; at
noon, and Temu in the evening." Meanwhile the poison
of the serpent was coursing through the veins of R&#257;, and the
enumeration of his works afforded the god no relief from it.
Then Isis said to R&#257;, "Among all the things which thou hast
named to me thou hast not named thy name. Tell me thy
name, and the poison shall come forth from thee." R&#257; still
hesitated, but the poison was burning in his blood, and the
heat thereof was stronger than that of a fierce fire. At
length he said, "Isis shall search me through, and my name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_77" id="Pg_77" title="Pg_77">[77]</a></span>shall come forth from my body and pass into hers." Then
R&#257; hid himself from the gods, and for a season his throne in
the Boat of Millions of Years was empty. When the time
came for the heart of the god to pass into Isis, the goddess
said to Horus, her son, "The great god shall bind himself
by an oath to give us his two eyes (<i>i.e.</i> the sun and the moon)."
When the great god had yielded up his name Isis pronounced
the following spell: "Flow poison, come out of R&#257;. Eye of
Horus, come out of the god, and sparkle as thou comest through
his mouth. I am the worker. I make the poison to fall on
the ground. The poison is conquered. Truly the name of
the great god hath been taken from him. R&#257; liveth! The
poison dieth! If the poison live R&#257; shall die." These were
the words which Isis spoke, Isis the great lady, the Queen of
the gods, who knew R&#257; by his own name.</p>

<p>In late times magicians used to write the above Legend

gave R&#257; his secret name, and over figures of Isis and Horus,
and sell the rolls as charms against snake bites.<br /><br /></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Legend of Horus of Behutet and the Winged Disk</span></h3>

<p>The text of this Legend is cut in hieroglyphs on the walls
of the temple of Edfu, in Upper Egypt, and some of the
incidents described in it are illustrated by large bas-reliefs.
The form of the Legend here given dates from the Ptolemaic
Period, but the subject matter is some thousands of years
older. The great historical fact underlying the Legend is
the Conquest of Egypt by some very early king who invaded
Egypt from the south, and who succeeded in conquering
every part of it, even the northern part of the Delta. The
events described are supposed to have taken place whilst
R&#257; was still reigning on the earth. The Legend states that
in the three hundred and sixty-third year of the reign of R&#257;-Harmakhis,
the ever living, His Majesty was in Ta-sti (<i>i.e.</i>
the Land of the Bow, or Nubia) with his soldiers; the enemy
had reviled him, and for this reason the land is called "Uauatet"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_78" id="Pg_78" title="Pg_78">[78]</a></span>to this day. From Nubia R&#257; sailed down the river
to Apollinopolis (Edfu), and Heru-Behutet, or Horus of
Edfu, was with him. On arriving there Horus told R&#257; that
the enemy were plotting against him, and R&#257; told him to go
out and slay them. Horus took the form of a great winged
disk, which flew up into the air and pursued the enemy, and
it attacked them with such terrific force that they could
neither see nor hear, and they fell upon each other, and slew
each other, and in a moment not a single foe was left alive.
Then Horus returned to the Boat of R&#257;-Harmakhis, in the
form of the winged disk which shone with many colours, and
said, "Advance, O R&#257;, and look upon thine enemies who
are lying under thee in this land." R&#257; set out on the journey,
taking with him the goddess Ashtoreth, and he saw his
enemies lying on the ground, each of them being fettered.
After looking upon his slaughtered foes R&#257; said to the gods
who were with him, "Behold, let us sail in our boat on the
water, for our hearts are glad because our enemies have been
overthrown on the earth." So the Boat of R&#257; moved onwards
towards the north, and the enemies of the god who were on
the banks took the form of crocodiles and hippopotami, and
tried to frighten the god, for as his boat came near them they
opened their jaws wide, intending to swallow it up together
with the gods who were in it. Among the crew were the
Followers of Horus of Edfu, who were skilled workers in metal,
and each of these had in his hands an iron spear and a chain.
These "Blacksmiths" threw out their chains into the river
and allowed the crocodiles and hippopotami to entangle
their legs in them, and then they dragged the beasts towards
the bows of the Boat, and driving their spears into their
bodies, slew them there. After the slaughter the bodies of
six hundred and fifty-one crocodiles were brought and laid
out before the town of Edfu. When Thoth saw these he said,
"Let your hearts rejoice, O gods of heaven, Let your hearts
rejoice, O ye gods who dwell on the earth. The Young Horus
cometh in peace. On his way he hath made manifest deeds of
valour, according to the Book of slaying the Hippopotamus."
And from that day they made figures of Horus in metal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_79" id="Pg_79" title="Pg_79">[79]</a></span>Then Horus of Edfu took the form of the winged disk,
and set himself on the prow of the Boat of R&#257;. He took with
him Nekhebet, goddess of the South, and Uatchet, goddess of
the North, in the form of serpents, so that they might make
all the enemies of the Sun-god to quake in the South and in
the North. His foes who had fled to the north doubled back
towards the south, for they were in deadly fear of the god.
Horus pursued and overtook them, and he and his blacksmiths
had in their hands spears and chains, and they slew
large numbers of them to the south-east of the town of
Thebes in Upper Egypt. Many succeeded in escaping
towards the north once more, but after pursuing them for a
whole day Horus overtook them, and made a great slaughter
among them. Meanwhile the other foes of the god, who
had heard of the defeats of their allies, fled into Lower Egypt,
and took refuge among the swamps of the Delta. Horus
set out after them, and came up with them, and spent four
days in the water slaying his foes, who tried to escape in
the forms of crocodiles and hippopotami. He captured one
hundred and forty-two of the enemy and a male hippopotamus,
and took them to the fore part of the Boat of R&#257;. There
he hacked them in pieces, and gave their inward parts to his
followers, and their mutilated bodies to the gods and goddesses
who were in the Boat of R&#257; and on the river banks
in the town of Heben.</p>

<p>Then the remnant of the enemy turned their faces towards
the Lake of the North, and they attempted to sail to the
Mediterranean in boats; but the terror of Horus filled their
hearts, and they left their boats and fled to the district of
Mertet-Ament, where they joined themselves to the worshippers
of Set, the god of evil, who dwelt in the Western
Delta. Horus pursued them in his boat for one day and
one night without seeing them, and he arrived at the town
of Per-Rehui. At length he discovered the position of the
enemy, and he and his followers fell upon them, and slew a
large number of them; he captured three hundred and eighty-one
of them alive, and these he took to the Boat of R&#257;, then,
having slain them, he gave their carcases to his followers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_80" id="Pg_80" title="Pg_80">[80]</a></span>or bodyguard, who presumably devoured them. The custom
of eating the bodies of enemies is very old in Egypt, and
survives in some parts of Africa to this day.</p>

<p>Then Set, the great antagonist of Horus, came out and
cursed him for the slaughter of his people, using most shameful
words of abuse. Horus stood up and fought a duel with
Set, the "Stinking Face," as the text calls him, and Horus
succeeded in throwing him to the ground and spearing him.
Horus smashed his mouth with a blow of his mace, and having
fettered him with his chain, he brought him into the presence
of R&#257;, who ordered that he was to be handed over to Isis
and her son Horus, that they might work their will on him.
Here we must note that the ancient editor of the Legend
has confounded Horus the ancient Sun-god with Horus, son
of Isis, son of Osiris. Then Horus, the son of Isis, cut off the
heads of Set and his followers in the presence of R&#257;, and
dragged Set by his feet round about throughout the district
with his spear driven through his head and back, according
to the order of R&#257;. The form which Horus of Edfu had at
that time was that of a man of great strength, with the face
and back of a hawk; on his head he wore the Double Crown,
with feathers and serpents attached, and in his hands he held
a metal spear and a metal chain. And Horus, the son of
Isis, took upon himself a similar form, and the two Horuses
slew all the enemies on the bank of the river to the west of
the town of Per-Rehui. This slaughter took place on the
seventh day of the first month of the season Pert,<a name="FNanchor_1_88" id="FNanchor_1_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_88" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which was
ever afterwards called the "Day of the Festival of Sailing."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_88" id="Footnote_1_88"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_88"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> About the middle of November.</p></div>

<p>Now, although Set in the form of a man had been slain,
he reappeared in the form of a great hissing serpent, and
took up his abode in a hole in the ground without being
noticed by Horus. R&#257;, however, saw him, and gave orders
that Horus, the son of Isis, in the form of a hawk-headed
staff, should set himself at the mouth of the hole, so that the
monster might never reappear among men. This Horus
did, and Isis his mother lived there with him. Once again
it became known to R&#257; that a remnant of the followers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_81" id="Pg_81" title="Pg_81">[81]</a></span>Set had escaped, and that under the direction of the Smait
fiends, and of Set, who had reappeared, they were hiding in
the swamps of the Eastern Delta. Horus of Edfu, the winged
disk, pursued them, speared them, and finally slew them in
the presence of R&#257;. For the moment there were no more
enemies of R&#257; to be found in the district on land, although
Horus passed six days and six nights in looking for them;
but it seems that several of the followers of Set in the forms
of water reptiles were lying on the ground under water, and
that Horus saw them there. At this time Horus had strict
guard kept over the tomb of Osiris in Anrutef,<a name="FNanchor_1_89" id="FNanchor_1_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_89" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> because he
learned that the Smait fiends wanted to come and wreck
both it and the body of the god. Isis, too, never ceased to
recite spells and incantations in order to keep away her
husband's foes from his body. Meanwhile the "blacksmiths"
of Horus, who were in charge of the "middle
regions" of Egypt, found a body of the enemy, and attacked
them fiercely, slew many of them, and took one hundred
and six of them prisoners. The "blacksmiths" of the west
also took one hundred and six prisoners, and both groups of
prisoners were slain before R&#257;. In return for their services
R&#257; bestowed dwelling-places upon the "blacksmiths," and
allowed them to have temples with images of their gods in
them, and arranged for offerings and libations to be made
to them by properly appointed priests of various classes.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_89" id="Footnote_1_89"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_89"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> A district of Herakleopolis.</p></div>

<p>Shortly after these events R&#257; discovered that a number
of his enemies were still at large, and that they had sailed
in boats to the swamps that lay round about the town of
Tchal, or Tchar, better known as Zoan or Tanis. Once more
Horus unmoored the Boat of R&#257;, and set out against them;
some took refuge in the waters, and others landed and escaped
to the hilly land on the east. For some reason, which is not
quite apparent, Horus took the form of a mighty lion with
a man's face, and he wore on his head the triple crown. His
claws were like flints, and he pursued the enemy on the hills,
and chased them hither and thither, and captured one hundred
and forty-two of them. He tore out their tongues,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_82" id="Pg_82" title="Pg_82">[82]</a></span>and ripped their bodies into strips with his claws, and gave
them over to his allies in the mountains, who, no doubt, ate
them. This was the last fight in the north of Egypt, and R&#257;
proposed that they should sail up the river and return to the
south. They had traversed all Egypt, and sailed over the
lakes in the Delta, and down the arms of the Nile to the
Mediterranean, and as no more of the enemy were to be seen
the prow of the boat of R&#257; was turned southwards. Thoth
recited the spells that produced fair weather, and said the
words of power that prevented storms from rising, and in
due course the Boat reached Nubia. When it arrived Horus
found in the country of Uauatet men who were conspiring
against him and cursing him, just as they had at one time
blasphemed R&#257;. Horus, taking the form of the winged disk,
and accompanied by the two serpent-goddesses, Nekhebet
and Uatchet, attacked the rebels, but there was no fierce
fighting this time, for the hearts of the enemy melted through
fear of him. His foes cast themselves before him on the
ground in submission, they offered no resistance, and they
died straightway. Horus then returned to the town of
Behutet (Edfu), and the gods acclaimed him, and praised his
prowess. R&#257; was so pleased with him that he ordered
Thoth to have a winged disk, with a serpent on each side of
it, placed in every temple in Egypt in which he (<i>i.e.</i> R&#257;) was
worshipped, so that it might act as a protector of the building,
and drive away any and every fiend and devil that
might wish to attack it. This is the reason why we find
the winged disk, with a serpent on each side of it, above
the doors of temples and religious buildings throughout the
length and breadth of Egypt.</p>

<p>In many places in the text that contains the above Legend
there are short passages in which attempts are made to explain
the origins of the names of certain towns and gods. All
these are interpolations in the narrative made by scribes at
a late period of Egyptian history. As it would be quite
useless to reproduce them without many explanatory notes,
for which there is no room in this little book, they have been
omitted.<br /><br /></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Legend of Khnemu and a Seven Years' Famine</span></h3>

<p>This Legend is cut in hieroglyphs on a large rounded block
of granite, which stands on the south-east portion of S&#257;hal,
a little island in the First Cataract in Upper Egypt, two or
three miles to the south of the modern town of Asw&#257;n, the
ancient Syene. The form of the Legend, and the shapes of
the hieroglyphs, and the late spelling of the words, prove
that the inscription is the work of the Ptolemaic Period,
though it is possible that the Legend in its simplest form is
as old as the period to which it is ascribed in the S&#257;hal text,
namely, the third dynasty, about 4100 B.C. The subject of
the Legend is a terrible famine, which lasted for seven years,
in the reign of King Tcheser, and which recalls the seven
years' famine that took place in Egypt when Joseph was
there. This famine was believed to have been caused by the
king's neglect to worship properly the god Khnemu, who
was supposed to control the springs of the Nile, which were
asserted by the sages to be situated between two great rocks
on the Island of Elephantine. The Legend sets forth that
the Viceroy of Nubia, in the reign of Tcheser, was a nobleman
called Meter, who was also the overseer of all the temple
properties in the South. His residence was in Abu, or Elephantine,
and in the eighteenth year of his reign the king
sent him a despatch in which it was written thus: "This is
to inform thee that misery hath laid hold upon me as I sit
upon the great throne, and I grieve for those who dwell in
the Great House.<a name="FNanchor_1_90" id="FNanchor_1_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_90" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> My heart is grievously afflicted by reason
of a very great calamity, which is due to the fact that the
waters of the Nile have not risen to their proper height for
seven years. Grain is exceedingly scarce, there are no garden
herbs and vegetables to be had at all, and everything which
men use for food hath come to an end. Every man robbeth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_84" id="Pg_84" title="Pg_84">[84]</a></span>his neighbour. The people wish to walk about, but are unable
to move. The baby waileth, the young man shuffleth
along on his feet through weakness. The hearts of the old men
are broken down with despair, their legs give way under them,
they sink down exhausted on the ground, and they lay their
hands on their bellies [in pain]. The officials are powerless
and have no counsel to give, and when the public granaries,
which ought to contain supplies, are opened, there cometh

<p>Having read the royal despatch the Viceroy Meter set out
to go to the king, and when he came to him he proceeded
to instruct the king in the matters about which he had asked
questions. The text makes the king say: "[Meter] gave me
information about the rise of the Nile, and he told me all
that men had written concerning it; and he made clear to
me all the difficult passages [in the books], which my ancestors
had consulted hastily, and which had never before been
explained to any king since the time when R&#257; [reigned].
And he said to me: There is a town in the river wherefrom
the Nile maketh his appearance. 'Abu' was its name in
the beginning: it is the City of the Beginning, it is the Name
of the City of the Beginning. It reacheth to Uauatet,
which is the first land [on the south]. There is a long flight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_85" id="Pg_85" title="Pg_85">[85]</a></span>of steps there (a nilometer?), on which R&#257; resteth when he
determineth to prolong life to mankind. It is called 'Netchemtchem
&#257;nkh.' Here are the 'Two Qerti,'<a name="FNanchor_1_95" id="FNanchor_1_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_95" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which are
the two breasts wherefrom every good thing cometh. Here
is the bed of the Nile, here the Nile-god reneweth his youth,
and here he sendeth out the flood on the land. Here his
waters rise to a height of twenty-eight cubits; at Hermopolis
(in the Delta) their height is seven cubits. Here the Nile-god
smiteth the ground with his sandals, and here he draweth
the bolts and throweth open the two doors through which
the water poureth forth. In this town the Nile-god dwelleth
in the form of Shu, and he keepeth the account of the products
of all Egypt, in order to give to each his due. Here
are kept the cord for measuring land and the register of the
estates. Here the god liveth in a wooden house with a door
made of reeds, and branches of trees form the roof; its
entrance is to the south-east. Round about it are mountains
of stone to which quarrymen come with their tools when they
want stone to build temples to the gods, shrines for sacred
animals, and pyramids for kings, or to make statues. Here
they offer sacrifices of all kinds in the sanctuary, and here
their sweet-smelling gifts are presented before the face of
the god Khnemu. In the quarries on the river bank is
granite, which is called the 'stone of Abu.' The names of
its gods are: Sept (Sothis, the dog-star), &#256;nqet, Hep (the
Nile-god), Shu, Keb, Nut, Osiris, Horus, Isis, and Nephthys.
Here are found precious stones (a list is given), gold, silver,
copper, iron, lapis-lazuli, emerald, crystal, ruby, &amp;c., alabaster,
mother-of-emerald, and seeds of plants that are used in
making incense. These were the things which I learned
from Meter [the Viceroy]."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_95" id="Footnote_1_95"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_95"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The two caverns which contained the springs of the Nile.</p></div>

<p>Having informed the king concerning the rise of the Nile
and the other matters mentioned in his despatch, Meter
made arrangements for the king to visit the temple of Khnemu
in person. This he did, and the Legend gives us the king's
own description of his visit. He says: I entered the temple,
and the keepers of the rolls untied them and showed them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_86" id="Pg_86" title="Pg_86">[86]</a></span>to me. I was purified by the sprinkling of holy water, and I
passed through the places that were prohibited to ordinary
folk, and a great offering of cakes, ale, geese, oxen, &amp;c., was
offered up on my behalf to the gods and goddesses of Abu.
Then I found the god [Khnemu] standing in front of me,
and I propitiated him with the offerings that I made unto
him, and I made prayer and supplication before him. Then
he opened his eyes,<a name="FNanchor_1_96" id="FNanchor_1_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_96" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and his heart inclined to me, and in
a majestic manner he said unto me: "I am Khnemu who
fashioned thee. My two hands grasped thee and knitted
together thy body; I made thy members sound, and I gave
thee thy heart. Yet the stones have been lying under the
ground for ages, and no man hath worked them in order to
build a god-house, to repair the [sacred] buildings which are
in ruins, or to make shrines for the gods of the South and
North, or to do what he ought to do for his lord, even though
I am the Lord [the Creator]. I am Nu, the self-created, the
Great God, who came into being in the beginning. [I am]
Hep [the Nile-god] who riseth at will to give health to him
that worketh for me. I am the Governor and Guide of all
men, in all their periods, the Most Great, the Father of the
gods, Shu, the Great One, the Chief of the earth. The two
halves of heaven are my abode. The Nile is poured out in
a stream by me, and it goeth round about the tilled lands,
and its embrace produceth life for every one that breatheth,
according to the extent of its embrace.... I will make the
Nile to rise for thee, and in no year shall it fail, and it shall
spread its water out and cover every land satisfactorily.
Plants, herbs, and trees shall bend beneath [the weight of]
their produce. The goddess Rennet (the Harvest goddess)
shall be at the head of everything, and every product shall
increase a hundred thousandfold, according to the cubit of
the year.<a name="FNanchor_2_97" id="FNanchor_2_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_97" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The people shall be filled, verily to their hearts'
desire, yea, everyone. Want shall cease, and the emptiness
of the granaries shall come to an end. The Land of Mera
(<i>i.e.</i> Egypt) shall be one cultivated land, the districts shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_87" id="Pg_87" title="Pg_87">[87]</a></span>be yellow with crops of grain, and the grain shall be good.
The fertility of the land shall be according to the desire [of
the husbandman], and it shall be greater than it hath ever
been before." At the sound of the word "crops" the king
awoke, and the courage that then filled his heart was as great
as his former despair had been.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_96" id="Footnote_1_96"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_96"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The king was standing before a statue with movable eyes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_97" id="Footnote_2_97"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_97"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> <i>i.e.</i> the number of the cubits which the waters of the Nile shall rise.</p></div>

<p>Having left the chamber of the god the king made a decree
by which he endowed the temple of Khnemu with lands and
gifts, and he drew up a code of laws under which every farmer
was compelled to pay certain dues to it. Every fisherman
and hunter had to pay a tithe. Of the calves cast one tenth
were to be sent to the temple to be offered up as the daily
offering. Gold, ivory, ebony, spices, precious stones, and
woods were tithed, whether their owners were Egyptians or
not, but no local tribe was to levy duty on these things on
their road to Abu. Every artisan also was to pay tithe,
with the exception of those who were employed in the
foundry attached to the temple, and whose occupation consisted
in making the images of the gods. The king further
ordered that a copy of this decree, the original of which was
cut in wood, should be engraved on a stele to be set up in
the sanctuary, with figures of Khnemu and his companion
gods cut above it. The man who spat upon the stele [if
discovered] was to be "admonished with a rope."<br /><br /></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Legend of the Wanderings of Isis</span></h3>

<p>The god Osiris, as we have seen in the chapter on the
Egyptian Religion in the accompanying volume, lived and
reigned at one time upon earth in the form of a man. His
twin-brother Set was jealous of his popularity, and hated
him to such a degree that he contrived a plan whereby he
succeeded in putting Osiris to death. Set then tried to
usurp his brother's kingdom and to make himself sole lord
of Egypt, and, although no text states it distinctly, it is clear
that he seized his brother's wife, Isis, and shut her up in his
house. Isis was, however, under the protection of the god
Thoth, and she escaped with her unborn child, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_88" id="Pg_88" title="Pg_88">[88]</a></span>following Legend describes the incidents that befell her, and
the death and revivification of Horus. It is cut in hieroglyphs
upon a large stone stele which was made for &#256;nkh-Psemthek,
a prophet of Nebun in the reign of Nectanebus I,
who reigned from 373 B.C. to 360 B.C. The stele was dug
up in 1828 at Alexandria, and was given to Prince Metternich
by Muhammad Al&#299; P&#257;sha; it is now commonly known
as the "Metternich Stele." The Legend is narrated by the
goddess herself, who says:</p>

<p>I am Isis. I escaped from the dwelling wherein my brother
Set placed me. Thoth, the great god, the Prince of Truth
in heaven and on earth, said unto me: "Come, O goddess
Isis [hearken thou], it is a good thing to hearken, for he who
is guided by another liveth. Hide thyself with thy child,
and these things shall happen unto him. His body shall
grow and flourish, and strength of every kind shall be in him.
He shall sit upon his father's throne, he shall avenge him,
and he shall hold the exalted position of 'Governor of the
Two Lands.'" I left the house of Set in the evening, and
there accompanied me Seven Scorpions, that were to travel
with me, and sting with their stings on my behalf. Two of
them, Tefen and Befen, followed behind me, two of them,
Mestet and Mestetef, went one on each side of me, and three,
Petet, Thetet, and Maatet, prepared the way for me. I
charged them very carefully and adjured them to make no
acquaintance with any one, to speak to none of the Red
Fiends, to pay no heed to a servant (?), and to keep their
gaze towards the ground so that they might show me the
way. And their leader brought me to Pa-Sui, the town of
the Sacred Sandals,<a name="FNanchor_1_98" id="FNanchor_1_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_98" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> at the head of the district of the Papyrus
Swamps. When I arrived at Teb I came to a quarter of the
town where women dwelt. And a certain woman of quality
spied me as I was journeying along the road, and she shut her
door in my face, for she was afraid because of the Seven
Scorpions that were with me. Then they took counsel concerning
her, and they shot out their poison on the tail of
Tefen. As for me, a peasant woman called Taha opened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_89" id="Pg_89" title="Pg_89">[89]</a></span>her door, and I went into the house of this humble woman.
Then the scorpion Tefen crawled in under the door of the
woman Usert [who had shut it in my face], and stung her
son, and a fire broke out in it; there was no water to put it
out, but the sky sent down rain, though it was not the time
of rain. And the heart of Usert was sore within her, and she
was very sad, for she knew not whether her son would live
or die; and she went through the town shrieking for help,
but none came out at the sound of her voice. And I was
sad for the child's sake, and I wished the innocent one to
live again. So I cried out to her, saying, Come to me! Come
to me! There is life in my mouth. I am a woman well
known in her town. I can destroy the devil of death by a
spell which my father taught me. I am his daughter, his
beloved one.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_98" id="Footnote_1_98"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_98"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> These places were in the seventh nome of Lower Egypt (Metelites).</p></div>

<p>Then Isis laid her hands on the child and recited this spell:</p>

<p>"O poison of Tefent, come forth, fall on the ground; go no
further. O poison of Befent, come forth, fall on the ground.
I am Isis, the goddess, the mistress of words of power. I
am a weaver of spells, I know how to utter words so that they
take effect. Hearken to me, O every reptile that biteth
(or stingeth), and fall on the ground. O poison of Mestet, go
no further. O poison of Mestetef, rise not up in his body.
O poison of Petet and Thetet, enter not his body. O poison
of Maatet, fall on the ground. Ascend not into heaven, I
command you by the beloved of R&#257;, the egg of the goose
which appeareth from the sycamore. My words indeed rule
to the uttermost limit of the night. I speak to you, O
scorpions. I am alone and in sorrow, and our names will
stink throughout the nomes.... The child shall live! The
poison shall die! For R&#257; liveth and the poison dieth.
Horus shall be saved through his mother Isis, and he who
is stricken shall likewise be saved." Meanwhile the fire in
the house of Usert was extinguished, and heaven was content
with the utterance of Isis. Then the lady Usert was filled
with sorrow because she had shut her door in the face of Isis,
and she brought to the house of the peasant woman gifts
for the goddess, whom she had apparently not recognised.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_90" id="Pg_90" title="Pg_90">[90]</a></span>The spells of the goddess produced, of course, the desired
effect on the poison, and we may assume that the life of the
child was restored to him. The second lot of gifts made to
Isis represented his mother's gratitude.</p>

<p>Exactly when and how Isis made her way to a hiding
place cannot be said, but she reached it in safety, and her son
Horus was born there. The story of the death of Horus she
tells in the following words: "I am Isis. I conceived a child,
Horus, and I brought him forth in a cluster of papyrus plants
(or, bulrushes). I rejoiced exceedingly, for in him I saw
one who would make answer for his father. I hid him, and
I covered him up carefully, being afraid of that foul one
[Set], and then I went to the town of Am, where the people
gave thanks for me because they knew I could cause them
trouble. I passed the day in collecting food for the child,
and when I returned and took Horus into my arms, I found
him, Horus, the beautiful one of gold, the boy, the child,
lifeless! He had bedewed the ground with the water of his
eye and with the foam of his lips. His body was motionless,
his heart did not beat, and his muscles were relaxed." Then
Isis sent forth a bitter cry, and lamented loudly her misfortune,
for now that Horus was dead she had none to protect
her, or to take vengeance on Set. When the people heard
her voice they went out to her, and they bewailed with her
the greatness of her affliction. But though all lamented on
her behalf there was none who could bring back Horus to
life. Then a "woman who was well known in her town, a
lady who was the mistress of property in her own right,"
went out to Isis, and consoled her, and assured her that the
child should live through his mother. And she said, "A
scorpion hath stung him, the reptile &#256;unab hath wounded
him." Then Isis bent her face over the child to find out if
he breathed, and she examined the wound, and found that
there was poison in it, and then taking him in her arms, "she
leaped about with him like a fish that is put upon hot coals,"
uttering loud cries of lamentation. During this outburst
of grief the goddess Nephthys, her sister, arrived, and she
too lamented and cried bitterly over her sister's loss; with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_91" id="Pg_91" title="Pg_91">[91]</a></span>her came the Scorpion-goddess Serqet. Nephthys at once
advised Isis to cry out for help to R&#257;, for, said she, it is wholly
impossible for the Boat of R&#257; to travel across the sky whilst
Horus is lying dead. Then Isis cried out, and made supplication
to the Boat of Millions of Years, and the Sun-god stopped
the Boat. Out of it came down Thoth, who was provided
with powerful spells, and, going to Isis, he inquired concerning
her trouble. "What is it, what is it, O Isis, thou goddess
of spells, whose mouth hath skill to utter them with supreme
effect? Surely no evil thing hath befallen Horus, for the
Boat of R&#257; hath him under its protection. I have come
from the Boat of the Disk to heal Horus." Then Thoth
told Isis not to fear, but to put away all anxiety from her
heart, for he had come to heal her child, and he told her that
Horus was fully protected because he was the Dweller in
his disk, and the firstborn son of heaven, and the Great
Dwarf, and the Mighty Ram, and the Great Hawk, and the
Holy Beetle, and the Hidden Body, and the Governor of the
Other World, and the Holy Benu Bird, and by the spells of
Isis and the names of Osiris and the weeping of his mother
and brethren, and by his own name and heart. Turning
towards the child Thoth began to recite his spells and said,
"Wake up, Horus! Thy protection is established. Make
thou happy the heart of thy mother Isis. The words of
Horus bind up hearts and he comforteth him that is in affliction.
Let your hearts rejoice, O ye dwellers in the heavens.
Horus who avenged his father shall make the poison to
retreat. That which is in the mouth of R&#257; shall circulate,
and the tongue of the Great God shall overcome [opposition].
The Boat of R&#257; standeth still and moveth not, and the Disk
(<i>i.e.</i> the Sun-god) is in the place where it was yesterday to
heal Horus for his mother Isis. Come to earth, draw nigh,
O Boat of R&#257;, O ye mariners of R&#257;; make the boat to move
and convey food of the town of Sekhem (<i>i.e.</i> Letopolis) hither,
to heal Horus for his mother Isis.... Come to earth, O
poison! I am Thoth, the firstborn son, the son of R&#257;. Tem
and the company of the gods have commanded me to heal
Horus for his mother Isis. O Horus, O Horus, thy Ka protecteth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_92" id="Pg_92" title="Pg_92">[92]</a></span>thee, and thy Image worketh protection for thee.
The poison is as the daughter of its own flame; it is destroyed
because it smote the strong son. Your temples
are safe, for Horus liveth for his mother." Then the child
Horus returned to life, to the great joy of his mother, and
Thoth went back to the Boat of Millions of Years, which at
once proceeded on its majestic course, and all the gods from
one end of heaven to the other rejoiced. Isis entreated either
R&#257; or Thoth that Horus might be nursed and brought up by
the goddesses of the town of Pe-Tep, or Buto, in the Delta,
and at once Thoth committed the child to their care, and instructed
them about his future. Horus grew up in Buto
under their protection, and in due course fought a duel with
Set, and vanquished him, and so avenged the wrong done
to his father by Set.<br /><br /></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Legend of Khensu-Nefer-Hetep and the
Princess of Bekhten</span></h3>

<p>Here for convenience' sake may be inserted the story of
the Possessed Princess of Bekhten and the driving out of the
evil spirit that was in her by Khensu-Nefer-hetep. The
text of the Legend is cut in hieroglyphs on a large sandstone
tablet which was discovered by J.F. Champollion in the
temple of Khensu at Thebes, and was removed by Prisse
d'Avennes in 1846 to Paris, where it is now preserved in the
Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale. The form of the Legend which we
have is probably the work of the priests of Khensu, about
1000 B.C., who wished to magnify their god, but the incidents
recorded are supposed to have taken place at the end of the
fourteenth century B.C., and there may indeed be historical
facts underlying the Legend. The text states that the king
of Egypt, Userma&#257;tr&#257;-setepenr&#257; R&#257;meses-meri-Amen, <i>i.e.</i>
Rameses II, a king of the nineteenth dynasty about 1300 B.C.,
was in the country of Nehern, or Mesopotamia, according to
his yearly custom, and that the chiefs of the country, even
those of the remotest districts from Egypt, came to do homage
to him, and to bring him gifts, <i>i.e.</i> to pay tribute. Their gifts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_93" id="Pg_93" title="Pg_93">[93]</a></span>consisted of gold, lapis-lazuli, turquoise, and costly woods
from the land of the god,<a name="FNanchor_1_99" id="FNanchor_1_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_99" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and each chief tried to outdo
his neighbour in the magnificence of his gifts. Among
these tributary chiefs was the Prince of Bekhten, who, in
addition to his usual gift, presented to the king his eldest
daughter, and he spake words of praise to the king, and
prayed for his life. His daughter was beautiful, and the
king thought her the most beautiful maiden in the world,
and he gave her the name of Neferu-R&#257; and the rank of
"chief royal wife," <i>i.e.</i> the chief wife of Pharaoh. When
His Majesty brought her to Egypt she was treated as the
Queen of Egypt.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_99" id="Footnote_1_99"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_99"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Southern Arabia and a portion of the east coast of Africa near
Somaliland.</p></div>

<p>One day in the late summer, in the fifteenth year of his
reign, his Majesty was in Thebes celebrating a festival in
honour of Father Amen, the King of the gods, in the temple
now known as the Temple of Luxor, when an official came
and informed the king that "an ambassador of the Prince
of Bekhten had arrived bearing many gifts for the Royal
Wife." The ambassador was brought into the presence
with his gifts, and having addressed the king in suitable
words of honour, and smelt the ground before His Majesty,
he told him that he had come to present a petition to him on
behalf of the Queen's sister, who was called Bentresht (<i>i.e.</i>
daughter of joy). The princess had been attacked by a
disease, and the Prince of Bekhten asked His Majesty to
send a skilled physician to see her. Straightway the king
ordered his magicians (or medicine men) to appear before
him, and also his nobles, and when they came he told them
that he had sent for them to come and hear the ambassador's
request. And, he added, choose one of your number who
is both wise and skilful; their choice fell upon the royal
scribe Tehuti-em-heb, and the king ordered him to depart
to Bekhten to heal the princess. When the magician arrived
in Bekhten he found that Princess Bentresht was under
the influence of a malignant spirit, and that this spirit
refused to be influenced in any way by him; in fact all his
wisdom and skill availed nothing, for the spirit was hostile
to him.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_95" id="Pg_95" title="Pg_95">[95]</a></span>Then the Prince of Bekhten sent a second messenger to
His Majesty, beseeching him to send a god to Bekhten to
overcome the evil spirit, and he arrived in Egypt nine years
after the arrival of the first ambassador. Again the king
was celebrating a festival of Amen, and when he heard of
the request of the Prince of Bekhten he went and stood
before the statue of Khensu, called "Nefer-hetep," and he
said, "O my fair lord, I present myself a second time before
thee on behalf of the daughter of the Prince of Bekhten."
He then went on to ask the god to transmit his power to
Khensu, "Pa-ari-sekher-em-Uast," the god who drives out
the evil spirits which attack men, and to permit him to go
to Bekhten and release the Princess from the power of the
evil spirit. And the statue of Khensu Nefer-hetep bowed
its head twice at each part of the petition, and this god bestowed
a fourfold portion of his spirit and power on Khensu
Pa-ari-sekher-em-Uast. Then the king ordered that the
god should set out on his journey to Bekhten carried in
a boat, which was accompanied by five smaller boats and
by chariots and horses. The journey occupied seventeen
months, and the god was welcomed on his arrival by the
Prince of Bekhten and his nobles with suitable homage and
many cries of joy. The god was taken to the place where
Princess Bentresht was, and he used his magical power upon
her with such good effect that she was made whole at once.
The evil spirit who had possessed her came out of her and
said to Khensu: "Welcome, welcome, O great god, who dost
drive away the spirits who attack men. Bekhten is thine;
its people, both men and women, are thy servants, and I
myself am thy servant. I am going to depart to the place
whence I came, so that thy heart may be content concerning
the matter about which thou hast come. I beseech Thy
Majesty to give the order that thou and I and the Prince of
Bekhten may celebrate a festival together." The god Khensu
bowed his head as a sign that he approved of the proposal,
and told his priest to make arrangements with the Prince
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_96" id="Pg_96" title="Pg_96">[96]</a></span>of Bekhten for offering up a great offering. Whilst this
conversation was passing between the evil spirit and the god
the soldiers stood by in a state of great fear. The Prince of
Bekhten made the great offering before Khensu and the evil
spirit, and the Prince and the god and the spirit rejoiced
greatly. When the festival was ended the evil spirit, by the
command of Khensu, "departed to the place which he loved."
The Prince and all his people were immeasurably glad at the
happy result, and he decided that he would consider the god
to be a gift to him, and that he would not let him return to
Egypt. So the god Khensu stayed for three years and nine
months in Bekhten, but one day, whilst the Prince was sleeping
on his bed, he had a vision in which he saw Khensu in
the form of a hawk leave his shrine and mount up into the
air, and then depart to Egypt. When he awoke he said to
the priest of Khensu, "The god who was staying with us
hath departed to Egypt; let his chariot also depart." And
the Prince sent off the statue of the god to Egypt, with rich
gifts of all kinds and a large escort of soldiers and horses.
In due course the party arrived in Egypt, and ascended to
Thebes, and the god Khensu Pa-ari-sekher-em-Uast went
into the temple of Khensu Nefer-hetep, and laid all the gifts
which he had received from the Prince of Bekhten before
him, and kept nothing for his own temple. This he did as
a proper act of gratitude to Khensu Nefer-hetep, whose gift
of a fourfold portion of his spirit had enabled him to overcome
the power of the evil spirit that possessed the Princess
of Bekhten. Thus Khensu returned from Bekhten in safety,
and he re-entered his temple in the winter, in the thirty-third
year of the reign of Rameses II. The situation of Bekhten
is unknown, but the name is probably not imaginary, and
the country was perhaps a part of Western Asia. The time
occupied by the god Khensu in getting there does not necessarily
indicate that Bekhten was a very long way off, for a
mission of the kind moved slowly in those leisurely days,
and the priest of the god would probably be much delayed
by the people in the towns and villages on the way, who
would entreat him to ask the god to work cures on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_97" id="Pg_97" title="Pg_97">[97]</a></span>diseased and afflicted that were brought to him. We must
remember that when the Nubians made a treaty with
Diocletian they stipulated that the goddess Isis should be
allowed to leave her temple once a year, and to make a
progress through the country so that men and women might
ask her for boons, and receive them.<br /></p>

<h3>HISTORICAL LITERATURE<br /><br /></h3>


<p>The historical period of Egyptian history, that is to say,
the period during which Egypt was ruled by kings, each
one calling himself <span class="smcap">Nesu-bati</span>, or "King of the South, King
of the North," covers about 4400 years according to some
Egyptologists, and 3300 years according to others. Of the
kings of All Egypt who reigned during the period we know
the names of about two hundred, but only about one hundred
and fifty have left behind them monuments that enable us
to judge of their power and greatness. There is no evidence
to show that the Egyptians ever wrote history in our sense
of the word, and there is not in existence any native work
that can be regarded as a history of Egypt. The only known
attempt in ancient times to write a history of Egypt was
that made by Manetho, a skilled scribe and learned man,
who, in the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (289-246 B.C.),
undertook to write a history of the country, which was to
be placed in the Great Library at Alexandria. The only
portion of this History that has come down to us is the List
of Kings, which formed a section of it; this List, in a form
more or less accurate, is extant in the works of Africanus
and Eusebius. According to the former 553 or 554 kings ruled
over Egypt in 5380 years, and according to the latter 421
or 423 kings ruled over Egypt in 4547 or 4939 years. It is
quite certain that the principal acts and wars of each king
were recorded by the court scribes, or official "remembrancer"
or "recorder" of the day, and there is no doubt that
such records were preserved in the "House of Books," or
Library, of the local temple for reference if necessary. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_99" id="Pg_99" title="Pg_99">[99]</a></span>this were not so it would have been impossible for the scribes
of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties to compile the
lists of kings found on the Palermo Stone, and in the Turin
Papyrus, and on the Tablets set up by Seti I and Rameses II
at Abydos, and on the Tablet of Ancestors at Karnak.
These Lists, however, seem to show that the learned scribes
of the later period were not always sure of the true sequence
of the names, and that when they were dealing with the
names of the kings of the first two dynasties they were not
always certain even about the correct spelling and reading
of their names. The reason why the Egyptians did not
write the history of their country from a general point of
view is easily explained. Each king wished to be thought
as great as possible, and each king's courtiers lost no opportunity
of showing that they believed him to be the greatest
king who had sat on the throne of Egypt. To magnify the
deeds of his ancestors was neither politic nor safe, nor did
it lead to favours or promotion. In no inscription of their
descendants do we find the mighty deeds and great conquests
of Amenemh&#257;t III, or of Usertsen III, or of Thothmes
III, praised or described, and no court scribe ever dared to
draft a text stating that these were truly three of the greatest
kings of Egypt. When a local chief succeeded in making
himself king of All Egypt he did not concern himself with
preserving records of the great deeds of the king whose
throne he had seized. When foreign foes invaded Egypt
and conquered it their followers raided the towns, burnt and
destroyed all that could be got rid of, and smashed the monuments
recording the prowess of the king they had overthrown.
The net result of all this is that the history of Egypt can only
be partially constructed, and that the sources of our information
are a series of texts that were written to glorify
individual kings, and not to describe the history of a dynasty,
or the general development of the country, or the working
out of a policy. In attempting to draw up a connected
account of a reign or period the funerary inscriptions of high
officials are often more useful than the royal inscriptions.
In the following pages are given extracts from annals, building
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_100" id="Pg_100" title="Pg_100">[100]</a></span>inscriptions, narratives of conquests, and "triumph
inscriptions" of an official character; specimens of the
funerary inscriptions that describe military expeditions,
and supply valuable information about the general history
of events, will be given in the chapter on Biographical
Inscriptions.</p>

<p>The earliest known annals are found on a stone which is
preserved in the Museum at Palermo, and which for this
reason is called "<b>The Palermo Stone</b>"; the Egyptian
text was first published by Signor A. Pellegrini in 1896.
How the principal events of certain years of the reigns of
kings from the Predynastic Period to the middle of the fifth
dynasty are noted is shown by the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>[Reign of] <span class="smcap">Seneferu</span>. Year ...</p>

<p>The building of Tuataua ships of <i>mer</i> wood of a hundred
capacity, and 60 royal boats of sixteen capacity.</p>

<p>Raid in the Land of the Blacks (<i>i.e.</i> the S&#363;d&#257;n), and the
bringing in of seven thousand prisoners, men and women,
and twenty thousand cattle, sheep, and goats.</p>

<p>Building of the Wall of the South and North [called]
House of Seneferu.</p>

<p>The bringing of forty ships of cedar wood (or perhaps
"laden with cedar wood").</p>

<p>The making of thirty-five ... 122 cattle</p>

capacity.</p>

<p>The numbering for the seventh time.</p>

<p>[Height of the Nile.] Five cubits, one hand, one finger.</p></div>

<p>The royal historical inscriptions of the first eleven dynasties
are very few, and their contents are meagre and unimportant.
As specimens of historical documents of the
twelfth dynasty the following may be quoted:<br /><br /></p>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_101" id="Pg_101" title="Pg_101">[101]</a></span></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Edict against the Blacks</span></h3>

<p>This short inscription is dated in the eighth year of the
reign of Usertsen III. "The southern frontier in the eighth
year under the Majesty of the King of the South and North,
Kh&#257;kaur&#257; (Usertsen III), endowed with life for ever. No
Black whatsoever shall be permitted to pass [this stone]
going down stream, whether travelling by land or sailing in
a boat, with cattle, asses, goats, &amp;c., belonging to the Blacks,
with the exception of such as cometh to do business in the
country of Aqen<a name="FNanchor_1_100" id="FNanchor_1_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_100" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or on an embassy. Such, however, shall
be well entreated in every way. No boats belonging to the
Blacks shall in future be permitted to pass down the river
by the region of Heh."<a name="FNanchor_2_101" id="FNanchor_2_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_101" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_100" id="Footnote_1_100"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_100"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> This district has not been identified.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_101" id="Footnote_2_101"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_101"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The district of Semnah and Kummah, about 40 miles south of W&#257;d&#299;
Halfah.</p></div>

<p>The methods of Usertsen III and his opinions of the
S&#363;d&#257;n&#299; folk are illustrated by the following inscription
which he set up at Semnah, a fort built by him at the foot
of the Second Cataract.</p>

<p>"In the third month<a name="FNanchor_1_102" id="FNanchor_1_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_102" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of the season Pert His Majesty
fixed the boundary of Egypt on the south at Heh (Semnah).
I made my boundary and went further up the river than my
fathers. I added greatly to it. I give commands [therein].
I am the king, and what is said by me is done. What my
heart conceiveth my hand bringeth to pass. I am [like]
the crocodile which seizeth, carrieth off, and destroyeth
without mercy. Words (or matters) do not remain dormant
in my heart. To the coward soft talk suggesteth longsuffering;
this I give not to my enemies. Him who attacketh me
I attack. I am silent in the matter that is for silence; I
answer as the matter demandeth. Silence after an attack
maketh the heart of the enemy bold. The attack must be
sudden like that of a crocodile. The man who hesitateth is
a coward, and a wretched creature is he who is defeated on
his own territory and turned into a slave. The Black understandeth
talk only. Speak to him and he falleth prostrate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_102" id="Pg_102" title="Pg_102">[102]</a></span>He fleeth before a pursuer, and he pursueth only him that
fleeth. The Blacks are not bold men; on the contrary,
they are timid and weak, and their hearts are cowed. My
Majesty hath seen them, and [what I say] is no lie.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_102" id="Footnote_1_102"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_102"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> = January-February.</p></div>

<p>"I seized their women, I carried off their workers in the
fields, I came to their wells, I slew their bulls, I cut their corn
and I burnt it. This I swear by the life of my father. I
speak the truth; there is no doubt about the matter, and that
which cometh forth from my mouth cannot be gainsaid.
Furthermore, every son of mine who shall keep intact this
boundary which My Majesty hath made, is indeed my son;
he is the son who protecteth his father, if he keep intact the
boundary of him that begot him. He who shall allow this
boundary to be removed, and shall not fight for it, is not my
son, and he hath not been begotten by me. Moreover, My
Majesty hath caused to be made a statue of My Majesty on
this my boundary, not only with the desire that ye should
prosper thereby, but that ye should do battle for it."<br /><br /></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Campaign of Thothmes II in the S&#363;d&#257;n</span></h3>

<p>The following extract illustrates the inscriptions in which
the king describes an expedition into a hostile country which
he has conducted with success. It is taken from an inscription
of Thothmes II, which is cut in hieroglyphs on a rock
by the side of the old road leading from Elephantine to
Phil&aelig;, and is dated in the first year of the king's reign.
The opening lines enumerate the names and titles of the king,
and proclaim his sovereignty over the Haunebu, or the
dwellers in the northern Delta and on the sea coast, Upper
and Lower Egypt, Nubia and the Eastern Desert, including
Sinai, Syria, the lands of the Fenkhu, and the countries that
lie to the south of the modern town of Khartum. The next
section states: "A messenger came in and saluted His
Majesty and said: The vile people of Kash (<i>i.e.</i> Cush, Northern
Nubia) are in revolt. The subjects of the Lord of the
Two Lands (<i>i.e.</i> the King of Egypt) have become hostile to
him, and they have begun to fight. The Egyptians [in Nubia]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_103" id="Pg_103" title="Pg_103">[103]</a></span>are driving down their cattle from the shelter of the stronghold
which thy father Thothmes [I] built to keep back the
tribes of the South and the tribes of the Eastern Desert."
The last part of the envoy's message seems to contain a
statement that some of the Egyptians who had settled in
Nubia had thrown in their lot with the S&#363;d&#257;n&#299; folk who were
in revolt. The text continues: "When His Majesty heard
these words he became furious like a panther (or leopard),
and he said: I swear by R&#257;, who loveth me, and by my
father Amen, king of the gods, lord of the thrones of the
Two Lands, that I will not leave any male alive among
them. Then His Majesty sent a multitude of soldiers into
Nubia, now this was his first war, to effect the overthrow of
all those who had rebelled against the Lord of the Two Lands,
and of all those who were disaffected towards His Majesty.
And the soldiers of His Majesty arrived in the miserable land
of Kash, and overthrew these savages, and according to the
command of His Majesty they left no male alive, except one
of the sons of the miserable Prince of Kash, who was carried
away alive with some of their servants to the place where
His Majesty was. His Majesty took his seat on his throne,
and when the prisoners whom his soldiers had captured were
brought to him they were placed under the feet of the good
god. Their land was reduced to its former state of subjection,
and the people rejoiced and their chiefs were glad.
They ascribed praise to the Lord of the Two Lands, and they
glorified the god for his divine beneficence. This took place
because of the bravery of His Majesty, whom his father Amen
loved more than any other king of Egypt from the very
beginning, the King of the South and North, &#256;akheperenr&#257;,
the son of R&#257;, Thothmes (II), whose crowns are glorious,
endowed with life, stability, and serenity, like R&#257; for ever."<br /><br /></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Capture of Megiddo by Thothmes III</span></h3>

<p>The following is the official account of the Battle of Megiddo
in Syria, which was won by Thothmes III in the twenty-third
year of his reign. The narrative is taken from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_104" id="Pg_104" title="Pg_104">[104]</a></span>Annals of Thothmes III. The king set out from Thebes
and marched into Syria, and received the submission of
several small towns, and having made his way with difficulty
through the hilly region to the south of the city of Megiddo,
he camped there to prepare for the battle. "Then the tents
of His Majesty were pitched, and orders were sent out to
the whole army, saying, Arm yourselves, get your weapons
ready, for we shall set out to do battle with the miserable
enemy at daybreak. The king sat in his tent, the officers
made their preparations, and the rations of the servants were
provided. The military sentries went about crying, Be firm
of heart. Be firm of heart. Keep watch, keep watch.
Keep watch over the life of the king in his tent. And a
report was brought to His Majesty that the country was
quiet, and that the foot soldiers of the south and north were
ready. On the twenty-first day of the first month of the
season Shemu (March-April) of the twenty-third year of the
reign of His Majesty, and the day of the festival of the new
moon, which was also the anniversary of the king's coronation,
at dawn, behold, the order was given to set the whole
army in motion. His Majesty set out in his chariot of silver-gold,
and he had girded on himself the weapons of battle,
like Horus the Slayer, the lord of might, and he was like unto
Menthu [the War-god] of Thebes, and Amen his father gave
strength to his arms. The southern half of the army was
stationed on a hill to the south of the stream K&#299;n&#257;, and the
northern half lay to the south-west of Megiddo; His Majesty
was between them, and Amen was protecting him and giving
strength to his body. His Majesty at the head of his army
attacked his enemies, and broke their line, and when they
saw that he was overwhelming them they broke and fled to
Megiddo in a panic, leaving their horses and their gold and
silver chariots on the field. [The fugitives] were pulled up
by the people over the walls into the city; now they let
down their clothes by which to pull them up. If the soldiers
of His Majesty had not devoted themselves to securing loot
of the enemy, they would have been able to capture the city
of Megiddo at the moment when the vile foes from Kadesh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_105" id="Pg_105" title="Pg_105">[105]</a></span>and the vile foes from this city were being dragged up
hurriedly over the walls into this city; for the terror of His
Majesty had entered into them, and their arms dropped
helplessly, and the serpent on his crown overthrew them.
Their horses and their chariots [which were decorated] with
gold and silver were seized as spoil, and their mighty men
of war lay stretched out dead upon the ground like fishes,
and the conquering soldiers of His Majesty went about
counting their shares. And behold, the tent of the vile chief
of the enemy, wherein was his son, was also captured. Then
all the soldiers rejoiced greatly, and they glorified Amen,
because he had made his son (<i>i.e.</i> the king) victorious on that
day, and they praised His Majesty greatly, and acclaimed
his triumph. And they collected the loot which they had
taken, viz. hands [cut off the dead], prisoners, horses, chariots
[decorated with] gold and silver," etc.</p>

<p>In spite of the joy of the army Thothmes was angry with
his troops for having failed to capture the city. Every rebel
chief was in Megiddo, and its capture would have been worth
more than the capture of a thousand other cities, for he
could have slain all the rebel chiefs, and the revolt would
have collapsed completely. Thothmes then laid siege to the
city, and he threw up a strong wall round about it, through
which none might pass, and the daily progress of the siege
was recorded on a leather roll, which was subsequently preserved
in the temple of Amen at Thebes. After a time the
chiefs in Megiddo left their city and advanced to the gate
in the siege-wall and reported that they had come to tender
their submission to His Majesty, and it was accepted. They
brought to him rich gifts of gold, silver, lapis-lazuli, turquoise,
wheat, wine, cattle, sheep, goats, &amp;c., and he reappointed many
of the penitent chiefs to their former towns as vassals of
Egypt. Among the gifts were 340 prisoners, 83 hands, 2041
mares, 191 foals, 6 stallions, a royal chariot with a golden
pole, a second royal chariot, 892 chariots, total 924 chariots;
2 royal coats of mail, 200 ordinary coats of mail, 502 bows,
7 tent poles inlaid with gold, 1929 cattle, 2000 goats, and
20,500 sheep.<br /><br /></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Conquests of Thothmes III summarised by
Amen-R&#257;, King of the Gods</span></h3>

<p>The conquests of Thothmes III were indeed splendid
achievements, and the scribes of his time summarised them
very skilfully in a fine text which they had cut in hieroglyphs
on a large stele at Karnak. The treatment is, of
course, somewhat poetical, but there are enough historical
facts underlying the statements to justify a rendering of it
being given in this chapter. The text is supposed to be a
speech of Amen-R&#257;, the lord of the thrones of the Two Lands,
to the king. He says:</p>

<p>"Thou hast come to me, thou hast rejoiced in beholding
my beneficence, O my son, my advocate, Menkheperr&#257;,
living for ever! I rise upon thee through my love for thee.
My heart rejoiceth at thy auspicious comings to my temple.
My hands knit together thy limbs with the fluid of life;
sweet unto me are thy gracious acts towards my person. I
have stablished thee in my sanctuary. I have made thee
to be a source of wonder [to men]. I have given unto thee
strength and conquests over all lands. I have set thy Souls
and the fear of thee in all lands. The terror of thee hath
penetrated to the four pillars of the sky. I have made great
the awe of thee in all bodies. I have set the roar of Thy
Majesty everywhere [in the lands of] the Nine Bows (<i>i.e.</i>
Nubia). The Chiefs of all lands are grouped in a bunch
within thy fist. I put out my two hands; I tied them in a
bundle for thee. I collected the Antiu of Ta-sti<a name="FNanchor_1_103" id="FNanchor_1_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_103" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in tens of
thousands and thousands, and I made captives by the hundred
thousand of the Northern Nations. I have cast down
thy foes under thy sandals, thou hast trampled upon the
hateful and vile-hearted foes even as I commanded thee.
The length and breadth of the earth are thine, and those
who dwell in the East and the West are vassals unto thee.
Thou hast trodden upon all countries, thy heart is expanded
(<i>i.e.</i> glad). No one dareth to approach Thy Majesty with<br /><br /></p>

breath of life. I have set the victories of Thy Majesty in
their minds. The fiery serpent Khut which is on thy forehead
burnt them up. It made thee to grasp as an easy prey
the Ketu peoples, it burnt up the dwellers in their marshes
with its fire. The Princes of the &#256;amu (Asiatics) have been
slaughtered, not one of them remains, and the sons of the

<p>"I have come, making thee to trample under foot the land

<p>"I have come, making thee to trample under foot those

<h3><span class="smcap">Summary of the Reign of Rameses III</span></h3>

<p>The reign of Rameses III is remarkable in the annals of
the New Empire, and the great works which this king carried
out, and his princely benefactions to the temples of Egypt,
are described at great length in his famous papyrus in the
British Museum (Harris, No. 1, No. 9999). The last section
of the papyrus contains an excellent historical summary of
the reign of Rameses III, and as it is one of the finest examples
of this class of literature a translation of it is here given.
The text is written in the hieratic character and reads:</p>

<p>King Userma&#257;tr&#257;-meri-Amen (Rameses III), life, strength,
health [be to him!] the great god, said unto the princes,
and the chiefs of the land, and the soldiers, and the charioteers,
and the Shartanau soldiers, and the multitudes of the
bowmen, and all those who lived in the land of Ta-mera
(Egypt), Hearken ye, and I will cause you to know the
splendid deeds which I did when I was king of men. The
land of Kamt was laid open to the foreigner, every man
[was ejected] from his rightful holding, there was no "chief
mouth" (<i>i.e.</i> ruler) for many years in olden times until the
new period [came]. The land of Egypt [was divided among]
chiefs and governors of towns, each one slew his neighbour.
... Another period followed with years of nothingness
(famine?). Arsu, a certain Syrian, was with them as governor,
he made the whole land to be one holding before him.
He collected his vassals, and mulcted them of their possessions
heavily. They treated the gods as if they were men,
and they offered up no propitiatory offerings in their temples.
Now when the gods turned themselves back to peace, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_111" id="Pg_111" title="Pg_111">[111]</a></span>to the restoration of what was right in the land, according
to its accustomed and proper form, they established their
son who proceeded from their body to be Governor, life,
strength, health [be to him!], of every land, upon their great
throne, namely, Userkh&#257;r&#257;-setep-en-Amen-meri-Amen, life
strength, health [be to him!], the son of R&#257;,
Set-nekht-merr-R&#257;-meri-Amen, life, strength, health [be to him!].
He was like Khepra-Set when he is wroth. He quieted the
whole country which had been in rebellion. He slew the
evil-hearted ones who were in Ta-mera (Egypt). He purified
the great throne of Egypt. He was the Governor, life,
strength, health [be to him!], of the Two Lands, on the
throne of Amen. He made to appear the faces that had
withdrawn themselves. Of those who had been behind
walls every man recognised his fellow. He endowed the
temples with offerings to offer as was right to the Nine Gods,
according to use and wont. He made me by a decree to be
the Hereditary Chief in the seat of Keb. I became the
"Great High Mouth" of the lands of Egypt, I directed the
affairs of the whole land, which had been made one. He
set on his double horizon (<i>i.e.</i> he died) like the Nine Gods.
There was performed for him what was performed for Osiris;
sailing in his royal boat on the river, and resting [finally] in
his house of eternity (<i>i.e.</i> the tomb) in Western Thebes.</p>

<p>My father Amen, the lord of the gods, R&#257;, Tem, and Ptah
of the Beautiful Face made me to be crowned lord of the
Two Lands in the place of my begetter. I received the rank
of my father with cries of joy. The land had peace, being
fed with offerings, and men rejoiced in seeing me, Governor,
life, strength, health [be to him!], of the Two Lands, like
Horus when he was made to be Governor of the Two Lands
on the throne of Osiris. I was crowned with the Atef crown
with the serpents, I bound on the crown with plumes, like
Tatenn. I sat on the throne of Heru-Khuti (Harmakhis).
I was arrayed in the ornaments [of sovereignty] like Tem.
I made Ta-mera to possess many [different] kinds of men,
the officers of the palace, the great chiefs, large numbers of
horse and chariot soldiers, hundreds of thousands of them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_112" id="Pg_112" title="Pg_112">[112]</a></span>the Shartanau and the Qehequ, who were numberless, soldiers
of the bodyguard in tens of thousands, and the peasants
belonging to Ta-mera.</p>

<p>I enlarged all the frontiers of Egypt, I conquered those
who crossed over them in their [own] lands. I slaughtered
the Tanauna in their islands; the Thakra and the Purastau
were made into a holocaust. The Shartanau and the
Uasheshu of the sea were made non-existent; they were
seized [by me] at one time, and were brought as captives to
Egypt, like the sand in the furrows. I provided fortresses
for them to dwell in, and they were kept in check by my
name. Their companies were very numerous, like hundreds
of thousands. I assessed every one of them for taxes yearly,
in apparel and wheat from the stores and granaries. I
crushed the S&#257;ara and the tribes of the Shasu (nomad shepherds).
I carried off their tents from their men, and the
equipment thereof, and their flocks and herds likewise,
which were without number. They were put in fetters and
brought along as captives, as offerings to Egypt, and I gave
them to the Nine Gods as slaves for their temples.</p>

<p>Behold, I will also make you to know concerning the other
schemes that have been carried out in Ta-mera during my
reign. The Labu (Libyans) and the Mashuashau had made
their dwelling in Egypt, for they had captured the towns on
the west bank of the Nile from Hetkaptah (Memphis) to
Qarabana. They had occupied also both banks of the
"Great River," and they had been in possession of the towns
(or villages) of Kutut<a name="FNanchor_1_104" id="FNanchor_1_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_104" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> for very, very many years whilst they
were [lords] over Egypt. Behold, I crushed them and
slaughtered them at one time (<i>i.e.</i> in one engagement). I
overthrew the Mashuashau, the Libyans, the Asbatau, the
Qaiqashau, the Shaiu, the Hasau, and the Baqanau. [I]
slaughtered them in their blood, and they became piles of
dead bodies. [Thus] I drove them away from marching over
the border of Egypt. The rest of them I carried away, a
vast multitude of prisoners, trussed like geese in front of my
horses, their women and their children in tens of thousands,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_113" id="Pg_113" title="Pg_113">[113]</a></span>and their flocks and herds in hundreds of thousands. I
allotted to their chiefs fortresses, and they lived there under
my name. I made them officers of the bowmen, and captains
of the tribes; they were branded with my name and
became my slaves; their wives and their children were likewise
turned into slaves. Their flocks and herds I brought
into the House of Amen, and they became his live-stock for
ever.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_104" id="Footnote_1_104"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_104"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Perhaps the district of Canopus.</p></div>

<p>I made a very large well in the desert of &#256;ina. It had a
girdle wall like a mountain of basalt(?), with twenty buttresses(?)
in the foundation [on] the ground, and its height
was thirty cubits, and it had bastions. The frame-work
and the doors were cut out of cedar, and the bolts thereof
and their sockets were of copper. I cut out large sea-going
boats, with smaller boats before them, and they were manned
with large crews, and large numbers of serving-men. With
them were the officers of the bowmen of the boats, and there
were trained captains and mates to inspect them. They
were loaded with the products of Egypt which were without
number, and they were in very large numbers, like tens of
thousands. These were despatched to the Great Sea of the
water of Qett (<i>i.e.</i> the Red Sea), they arrived at the lands of
Punt, no disaster followed them, and they were in an effective
state and were awe-inspiring. Both the large boats and the
little boats were laden with the products of the Land of the
God, and with all kinds of wonderful and mysterious things
which are produced in those lands, and with vast quantities
of the <i>&#257;nti</i> (myrrh) of Punt, which was loaded on to them by
tens of thousands [of measures] that were without number.
The sons of the chief of the Land of the God went in front
of their offerings, their faces towards Egypt. They arrived
and were sound and well at the mountain of Qebtit (Coptos),<a name="FNanchor_1_105" id="FNanchor_1_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_105" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
they moored their boats in peace, with the things which they
had brought as offerings. To cross the desert they were
loaded upon asses and on [the backs of] men, and they were
[re]loaded into river-barges at the quay of Coptos. They
were despatched down the river, they arrived during a festival,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_114" id="Pg_114" title="Pg_114">[114]</a></span>and some of the most wonderful of the offerings were
carried into the presence of [My Majesty]. The children of
their chiefs adored my face, they smelt the earth before my
face, and rolled on the ground. I gave them to all the gods
of this land to propitiate the two gods in front of me every
morning.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_105" id="Footnote_1_105"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_105"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <i>i.e.</i> the part at the Red Sea end of the Valley of Hamm&#257;m&#257;t.</p></div>

<p>I despatched my envoys to the desert of &#256;ataka to the
great copper workings that are in this place. Their sea-going
boats were laden with [some of] them, whilst those who
went through the desert rode on asses. Such a thing as this
was never heard of before, from the time when kings began
to reign. Their copper workings were found, and they were
full of copper, and the metal was loaded by ten thousands
[of measures] into their sea-going boats. They were despatched
with their faces towards Egypt, and they arrived
safely. The metal was lifted out and piled up under the
veranda in the form of blocks (or ingots) of copper, vast
numbers of them, as it were tens of thousands. They were
in colour like gold of three refinings. I allowed everybody
to see them, as they were wonderful things.</p>

<p>I despatched inspectors and overseers to the turquoise
desert (<i>i.e.</i> Sinai) of my mother, the goddess Hathor, the lady
of the turquoise. [They] carried to her silver, gold, byssus,
fine (?) linen, and many things as numerous as the sand-grains,
and laid them before her. And there were brought unto me
most wonderfully fine turquoises, real stones, in large numbers
of bags, and laid out before me. The like had never
been seen before&mdash;since kings began to reign.</p>

<p>I caused the whole country to be planted with groves of
trees and with flowering shrubs, and I made the people to
sit under the shade thereof. I made it possible for an Egyptian
woman to walk with a bold step to the place whither
she wished to go; no strange man attacked her, and no one
on the road. I made the foot-soldiers and the charioteers
sit down in my time, and the Shartanau and the Qehequ were
in their towns lying at full length on their backs; they were
unafraid, for there was no fighting man [to come] from Kash
(Nubia), [and no] enemy from Syria. Their bows and their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_115" id="Pg_115" title="Pg_115">[115]</a></span>weapons of war lay idle in their barracks, and they ate their
fill and drank their fill with shouts of joy. Their wives were
with them, [their] children were by their side; there was no
need to keep their eyes looking about them, their hearts
were bold, for I was with them as strength and protection
for their bodies. I kept alive (<i>i.e.</i> fed) the whole country,
aliens, artisans, gentle and simple, men and women. I
delivered a man from his foe and I gave him air. I rescued
him from the strong man, him who was more honourable
than the strong man. I made all men to have their rightful
positions in their towns. Some I made to live [taking them]
in the very chamber of the Tuat.<a name="FNanchor_1_106" id="FNanchor_1_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_106" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Where the land was
bare I covered it over again; the land was well filled during
my reign. I performed deeds of beneficence towards the
gods as well as towards men; I had no property that belonged
to the people. I served my office of king upon earth, as
Governor of the Two Lands, and ye were slaves under
my feet without [complaint ?]. Ye were satisfactory to my
heart, as were your good actions, and ye performed my
decrees and my words.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_106" id="Footnote_1_106"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_106"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The sick and needy who were at death's door.</p></div>

<p>Behold, I have set in Akert (the Other World) like my
father R&#257;. I am among the Great Companies of the gods of
heaven, earth, and the Tuat. Amen-R&#257; hath stablished my
son upon my throne, he hath received my rank in peace, as
Governor of the Two Lands, and he is sitting upon the
throne of Horus as Lord of the Two Nile-banks. He hath
put on himself the Atef crown like Ta-Tenn, Userma&#257;tr&#257;-setep-en-Amen,
life, strength, health [be to him!], the eldest-born
son of R&#257;, the self-begotten, Rameses (IV)-heqma&#257;t-meri-Amen,
life, strength, health [be to him!], the
divine child, the son of Amen, who came forth from his body,
rising as the Lord of the Two Lands, like Ta-Tenn. He is
like a real son, favoured for his father's sake. Tie ye yourselves
to his sandals. Smell the earth before him. Do
homage to him. Follow him at every moment. Praise
him. Worship him. Magnify his beneficent actions as ye
do those of R&#257; every morning. Present ye before him your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_116" id="Pg_116" title="Pg_116">[116]</a></span>offerings [in] his Great House (<i>i.e.</i> palace), which is holy.
Carry ye to him the "blessings" (?) of the [tilled] lands and
the deserts. Be strong to fulfil his words and the decrees
that are uttered among you. Follow (?) his utterances, and
ye shall be safe under his Souls. Work all together for
him in every work. Haul monuments for him, excavate
canals for him, work for him in the work of your hands, and
there will accrue unto you his favour as well as his food
daily. Amen hath decreed for him his sovereignty upon
earth, he hath made this period of his life twice as long as
that of any other king, the King of the South and North,
the Lord of the Two Lands, Userma&#257;tr&#257;-setep-en-Amen,
life, strength, health [be to him!], the son of R&#257;, the lord of
crowns, Rameses (IV)-heqma&#257;t-meri-Amen, life, strength,
health [be to him!], who is endowed with life for ever.<br /><br /></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Invasion and Conquest of Egypt by Pi&#257;nkhi,
King of Nubia</span></h3>

<p>The text describing the invasion and conquest of Egypt
by Pi&#257;nkhi, King of Nubia, is cut in hieroglyphs upon a
massive stone stele which was found among the ruins of
Pi&#257;nkhi's temple at Gebel Barkal, near the foot of the
Fourth Cataract, and which is now preserved in the Egyptian
Museum, Cairo. Although this composition does not belong
to the best period of Egyptian Literature, it is a very fine
work. The narrative is vivid, and the aim of the writer was
rather to state the facts of this splendid expedition than to
heap up empty compliments on the king; both the subject-matter
and the dress in which it appears are well worthy of
reproduction in an English form. The inscription is dated
in the twenty-first year of Pi&#257;nkhi's reign, and the king says:</p>

<p>"Hearken ye to [the account of] what I have done more
than my ancestors. I am a king, the emanation of the god,
the living offspring of the god Tem, who at birth was ordained
the Governor whom princes were to fear." His mother
knew before his birth that he was to be the Governor, he the
beneficent god, the beloved of the gods, the son of R&#257; who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_117" id="Pg_117" title="Pg_117">[117]</a></span>was made by his (the god's) hands, Pi&#257;nkhi-meri-Amen.
One came and reported to His Majesty that the great prince
Tafnekht had taken possession of all the country on the west
bank of the Nile in the Delta, from the swamps even to
Athi-taui<a name="FNanchor_1_107" id="FNanchor_1_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_107" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, that he had sailed up the river with a large force,
that all the people on both sides of the river had attached
themselves to him, and that all the princes and governors
and heads of temple-towns had flocked to him, and that
they were "about his feet like dogs." No city had shut its
gates before him, on the contrary, Mer-Tem, Per-sekhem-kheper-R&#257;,
Het-neter-Sebek, Per-Metchet, Thekansh, and all
the towns in the west had opened their gates to him. In the
east Het-benu, Taiutchait, Het-suten, and Pernebtepahet had
opened to him, and he had besieged Hensu (Herakleopolis)
and closely invested it. He had enclosed it like a serpent
with its tail in its mouth. "Those who would come out he
will not allow to come out, and those who would go in he will
not allow to go in, by reason of the fighting that taketh place
every day. He hath thrown soldiers round about it everywhere."
Pi&#257;nkhi listened to the report undismayed, and he
smiled, for his heart was glad. Presently further reports
of the uprising came, and the king learned that Nemart,
another great prince, had joined his forces to those of Tafnekht.
Nemart had thrown down the fortifications of
Nefrus, he had laid waste his own town, and had thrown off
his allegiance to Pi&#257;nkhi completely.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_107" id="Footnote_1_107"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_107"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> A fortress a few miles south of Memphis.</p></div>

<p>Then Pi&#257;nkhi sent orders to Puarma and Las(?)-mer-sekni,
the Nubian generals stationed in Egypt, and told them to
assemble the troops, to seize the territory of Hermopolis,
to besiege the city itself, to seize all the people, and cattle,
and the boats on the river, and to stop all the agricultural
operations that were going on; these orders were obeyed.
At the same time he despatched a body of troops to Egypt,
with careful instructions as to the way in which they were
to fight, and he bade them remember that they were fighting
under the protection of Amen. He added, "When ye arrive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_118" id="Pg_118" title="Pg_118">[118]</a></span>at Thebes, opposite the Apts,<a name="FNanchor_1_108" id="FNanchor_1_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_108" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> go into the waters of the river
and wash yourselves, then array yourselves in your finest
apparel, unstring your bows, and lay down your spears. Let
no chief imagine that he is as strong as the Lord of strength
(<i>i.e.</i> Amen), for without him there is no strength. The weak
of arm he maketh strong of arm. Though the enemy be many
they shall turn their backs in flight before the weak man,
and one shall take captive a thousand. Wet yourselves
with the water of his altars, smell the earth before him, and
say: O make a way for us! Let us fight under the shadow
of thy sword, for a child, if he be but sent forth by thee, shall
vanquish multitudes when he attacketh." Then the soldiers
threw themselves flat on their faces before His Majesty,
saying, "Behold, thy name breedeth strength in us. Thy
counsel guideth thy soldiers into port (<i>i.e.</i> to success). Thy
bread is in our bodies on every road, thy beer quencheth our
thirst. Behold, thy bravery hath given us strength, and at
the mere mention of thy name there shall be victory. The
soldiers who are led by a coward cannot stand firm. Who
is like unto thee? Thou art the mighty king who workest
with thy hands, thou art a master of the operations of war."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_108" id="Footnote_1_108"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_108"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <i>i.e.</i> the temples of Karnak and Luxor.</p></div>

<p>"Then the soldiers set out on their journey, and they
sailed down the river and arrived at Thebes, and they did
everything according to His Majesty's commands. And
again they set out, and they sailed down the river, and they
met many large boats sailing up the river, and they were full
of soldiers and sailors, and mighty captains from the North
land, every one fully armed to fight, and the soldiers of His
Majesty inflicted a great defeat on them; they killed a very
large but unknown number, they captured the boats, made
the soldiers prisoners, whom they brought alive to the place
where His Majesty was." This done they proceeded on their
way to the region opposite Herakleopolis, to continue the
battle. Again the soldiers of Pi&#257;nkhi attacked the troops
of the allies, and defeated and routed them utterly, and captured
their boats on the river. A large number of the enemy
succeeded in escaping, and landed on the west bank of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_119" id="Pg_119" title="Pg_119">[119]</a></span>river at Per-pek. At dawn these were attacked by Pi&#257;nkhi's
troops, who slew large numbers of them, and [captured]
many horses; the remainder, utterly terror-stricken, fled
northwards, carrying with them the news of the worst defeat
which they had ever experienced.</p>

<p>Nemart, one of the rebel princes, fled up the river in a boat,
and landed near the town of Un (Hermopolis), wherein he
took refuge. The Nubians promptly beleaguered the town
with such rigour that no one could go out of it or come in.
Then they reported their action to Pi&#257;nkhi, and when he
had read their report, he growled like a panther, and said,
"Is it possible that they have permitted any of the Northmen
to live and escape to tell the tale of his flight, and have
not killed them to the very last man? I swear by my life,
and by my love for R&#257;, and by the grace which Father Amen
hath bestowed upon me, that I will myself sail down the river,
and destroy what the enemy hath done, and I will make him
to retreat from the fight for ever." Pi&#257;nkhi also declared
his intention of stopping at Thebes on his way down the river,
so that he might assist at the Festival of the New Year, and
might look upon the face of the god Amen in his shrine at
Karnak and, said he, "After that I will make the Lands of
the North to taste my fingers." When the soldiers in Egypt
heard of their lord's wrath, they attacked Per-Metchet (Oxyrrhynchus),
and they "overran it like a water-flood"; a
report of the success was sent to Pi&#257;nkhi, but he was not
satisfied. Then they attacked Ta-tehen (Tehnah?), which
was filled with northern soldiers. The Nubians built a
tower with a battering ram and breached the walls, and they
poured into the town and slew every one they found. Among
the dead was the son of the rebel prince Tafnekht. This
success was also reported to Pi&#257;nkhi, but still he was not
satisfied. Het-Benu was also captured, and still he was not
satisfied.</p>

<p>In the middle of the summer Pi&#257;nkhi left Napata (Gebel
Barkal) and sailed down to Thebes, where he celebrated the
New Year Festival. From there he went down the river to Un
(Hermopolis), where he landed and mounted his war chariot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_120" id="Pg_120" title="Pg_120">[120]</a></span>he was furiously angry because his troops had not destroyed
the enemy utterly, and he growled at them like a panther.
Having pitched his camp to the south-west of the city, he
began to besiege it. He threw up a mound round about the
city, he built wooden stages on it which he filled with archers
and slingers, and these succeeded in killing the people of the
city daily. After three days "the city stank," and envoys
came bearing rich gifts to sue for peace. With the envoys
came the wife of Nemart and her ladies, who cast themselves
flat on their faces before the ladies of Pi&#257;nkhi's palace, saying,
"We come to you, O ye royal wives, ye royal daughters,
and royal sisters. Pacify ye for us Horus (<i>i.e.</i> the King), the
Lord of the Palace, whose Souls are mighty, and whose word
of truth is great." A break of fifteen lines occurs in the text
here, and the words that immediately follow the break indicate
that Pi&#257;nkhi is upbraiding Nemart for his folly and
wickedness in destroying his country, wherein "not a full-grown
son is seen with his father, all the districts round about
being filled with children." Nemart acknowledged his folly,
and then swore fealty to Pi&#257;nkhi, promising to give him
more gifts than any other prince in the country. Gold,
silver, lapis-lazuli, turquoise, copper, and precious stones of
all kinds were then presented, and Nemart himself led a horse
with his right hand, and held a sistrum made of gold and
lapis-lazuli in his left.</p>

<p>Pi&#257;nkhi then arose and went into the temple of Thoth,
and offered up oxen, and calves, and geese to the god, and
to the Eight Gods of the city. After this he went through
Nemart's palace, and then visited the stables "where the
horses were, and the stalls of the young horses, and he perceived
that they had been suffering from hunger. And he
said, 'I swear by my own life, and by the love which I have
for R&#257;, who reneweth the breath of life in my nostrils, that,
in my opinion, to have allowed my horses to suffer hunger is
the worst of all the evil things which thou hast done in the
perversity of thy heart.'" A list was made of the goods
that were handed over to Pi&#257;nkhi, and a portion of them
was reserved for the temple of Amen at Thebes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_121" id="Pg_121" title="Pg_121">[121]</a></span>The next prince to submit was the Governor of Herakleopolis,
and when he had laid before Pi&#257;nkhi his gifts he said:
"Homage to thee, Horus, mighty king, Bull, conqueror of
bulls. I was in a pit in hell. I was sunk deep in the depths
of darkness, but now light shineth on me. I had no friend
in the evil day, and none to support me in the day of battle.
Thou only, O mighty king, who hast rolled away the darkness
that was on me [art my friend]. Henceforward I am
thy servant, and all my possessions are thine. The city of
Hensu shall pay tribute to thee. Thou art the image of R&#257;,
and art the master of the imperishable stars. He was a
king, and thou art a king; he perished not, and thou shalt
not perish." From Hensu Pi&#257;nkhi went down to the canal
leading to the Fayy&#363;m and to Illah&#363;n and found the town
gates shut in his face. The inhabitants, however, speedily
changed their minds, and opened the gates to Pi&#257;nkhi, who
entered with his troops, and received tribute, and slew no
one. Town after town submitted as Pi&#257;nkhi advanced
northwards, and none barred his progress until he reached
Memphis, the gates of which were shut fast. When Pi&#257;nkhi
saw this he sent a message to the Memphites, saying: "Shut
not your gates, and fight not in the city that hath belonged
to Shu<a name="FNanchor_1_109" id="FNanchor_1_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_109" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> for ever. He who wisheth to enter may do so, he who
wisheth to come out may do so, and he who wisheth to travel
about may do so. I will make an offering to Ptah and the
gods of White Wall (Memphis). I will perform the ceremonies
of Seker in the Hidden Shrine. I will look upon
the god of his South Wall (<i>i.e.</i> Ptah), and I will sail down the
river in peace. No man of Memphis shall be harmed, not a
child shall cry out in distress. Look at the homes of the
South! None hath been slain except those who blasphemed
the face of the god, and only the rebels have suffered at the
block." These pacific words of Pi&#257;nkhi were not believed,
and the people of Memphis not only kept their gates shut,
but manned the city walls with soldiers, and they were foolish
enough to slay a small company of Nubian artisans and boatmen
whom they found on the quay of Memphis. Tafnekht,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_122" id="Pg_122" title="Pg_122">[122]</a></span>the rebel prince of Sa&#299;s, entered Memphis by night, and
addressed eight thousand of his troops who were there, and
encouraged them to resist Pi&#257;nkhi. He said to them:
"Memphis is filled with the bravest men of war in all the
Northland, and its granaries are filled with wheat, barley,
and grain of all kinds. The arsenal is full of weapons. A
wall goeth round the city, and the great fort is as strong as
the mason could make it. The river floweth along the east
side, and no attack can be made there. The byres are full
of cattle, and the treasury is well filled with gold, silver,
copper, apparel, incense, honey, and unguents.... Defend
ye the city till I return." Tafnekht mounted a horse and
rode away to the north.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_109" id="Footnote_1_109"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_109"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The son of Khepera, or Tem, or Nebertcher.</p></div>

<p>At daybreak Pi&#257;nkhi went forth to reconnoitre, and he
found that the waters of the Nile were lapping the city walls
on the north side of the city, where the sailing craft were
tied up. He also saw that the city was extremely well fortified,
and that there was no means whereby he could effect
an entrance into the city through the walls. Some of his
officers advised him to throw up a mound of earth about the
city, but this counsel was rejected angrily by Pi&#257;nkhi, for
he had thought out a simpler plan. He ordered all his boats
and barges to be taken to the quay of Memphis, with their
bows towards the city wall; as the water lapped the foot of
the wall, the boats were able to come quite close to it, and
their bows were nearly on a level with the top of the wall.
Then Pi&#257;nkhi's men crowded into the boats, and, when the
word of command was given, they jumped from the bows
of the boats on to the wall, entered the houses built near it,
and then poured into the city. They rushed through the
city like a waterflood, and large numbers of the natives were
slain, and large numbers taken prisoners. Next morning
Pi&#257;nkhi set guards over the temples to protect the property of
the gods, then he went into the great temple of Ptah and reinstated
the priests, and they purified the holy place with natron
and incense, and offered up many offerings. When the report
of the capture of Memphis spread abroad, numerous local chiefs
came to Pi&#257;nkhi, and did homage, and gave him tribute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_123" id="Pg_123" title="Pg_123">[123]</a></span>From Memphis he passed over to the east bank of the Nile
to make an offering to Temu of Heliopolis. He bathed his
face in the water of the famous "Fountain of the Sun," he
offered white bulls to R&#257; at Shaiqaem-Anu, and he went into
the great temple of the Sun-god. The chief priest welcomed
him and blessed him; "he performed the ceremonies of the
Tuat chamber, he girded on the <i>seteb</i> garment, he censed
himself, he was sprinkled with holy water, and he offered (?)
flowers in the chamber in which the stone, wherein the spirit
of the Sun-god abode at certain times, was preserved. He
went up the step leading to the shrine to look upon R&#257;, and
stood there. He broke the seal, unbolted and opened the
doors of the shrine, and looked upon Father R&#257; in Het-benben.
He paid adoration to the two Boats of R&#257;. (M&#257;tet
and Sektet), and then closed the doors of the shrine and
sealed them with his own seal." Pi&#257;nkhi returned to the
west bank of the Nile, and pitched his camp at Kaheni,
whither came a number of princes to tender their submission
and offer gifts to him. After a time it was reported
to Pi&#257;nkhi that Tafnekht, the head of the rebellion, had laid
waste his town, burnt his treasury and his boats, and had
entrenched himself at Mest with the remainder of his army.
Thereupon Pi&#257;nkhi sent troops to Mest, and they slew all
its inhabitants. Then Tafnekht sent an envoy to Pi&#257;nkhi
asking for peace, and he said, "Be at peace [with me]. I
have not seen thy face during the days of shame. I cannot
resist thy fire, the terror of thee hath conquered me. Behold,
thou art Nubti,<a name="FNanchor_1_110" id="FNanchor_1_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_110" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the Governor of the South, and Menth,<a name="FNanchor_2_111" id="FNanchor_2_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_111" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
the Bull with strong arms. Thou didst not find thy servant
in any town towards which thou hast turned thy face. I
went as far as the swamps of the Great Green (<i>i.e.</i> the Mediterranean),
because I was afraid of thy Souls, and because
thy word is a fire that worketh evil for me. Is not the heart
of Thy Majesty cooled by reason of what thou hast done
unto me? Behold, I am indeed a most wretched man.
Punish me not according to my abominable deeds, weigh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_124" id="Pg_124" title="Pg_124">[124]</a></span>them not in a balance as against weights; thy punishment
of me is already threefold. Leave the seed, and thou shalt
find it again in due season. Dig not up the young root
which is about to put forth shoots. Thy Ka and the terror
of thee are in my body, and the fear of thee is in my bones.
I have not sat in the house of drinking beer, and no one hath
brought to me the harp. I have only eaten the bread which
hunger demanded, and I have only drunk the water needed
[to slake] my thirst. From the day in which thou didst
hear my name misery hath been in my bones, and my head
hath lost its hair. My apparel shall be rags until Neith<a name="FNanchor_3_112" id="FNanchor_3_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_112" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> is
at peace with me. Thou hast brought on me the full weight
of misery; O turn thou thy face towards me, for, behold,
this year hath separated my Ka from me. Purge thy servant
of his rebellion. Let my goods be received into thy treasury,
gold, precious stones of all kinds, and the finest of my horses,
and let these be my indemnity to thee for everything. I
beseech thee to send an envoy to me quickly, so that he may
make an end of the fear that is in my heart. Verily I will
go into the temple, and in his presence I will purge myself,
and swear an oath of allegiance to thee by the God." And
Pi&#257;nkhi sent to him General Puarma and General Petamennebnesttaui,
and Tafnekht loaded them with gold, and
silver, and raiment, and precious stones, and he went into the
temple and took an oath by the God that he would never
again disobey the king, or make war on a neighbour, or
invade his territory without Pi&#257;nkhi's knowledge. So
Pi&#257;nkhi was satisfied and forgave him. After this the town
of Crocodilopolis tendered its submission, and Pi&#257;nkhi was
master of all Egypt. Then two Governors of the South and
two Governors of the North came and smelt the ground
before Pi&#257;nkhi, and these were followed by all the kings and
princes of the North, "and their legs were [weak] like those
of women." As they were uncircumcised and were eaters of
fish they could not enter the king's palace; only one, Nemart,
who was ceremonially pure, entered the palace. Pi&#257;nkhi
was now tired of conquests, and he had all the loot which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_125" id="Pg_125" title="Pg_125">[125]</a></span>had collected loaded on his barges, together with goods from
Syria and the Land of the God, and he sailed up the river
towards Nubia. The people on both banks rejoiced at the
sight of His Majesty, and they sang hymns of praise to him
as he journeyed southwards, and acclaimed him as the Conqueror
of Egypt. They also invoked blessings on his father
and mother, and wished him long life. When he returned to
Gebel Barkal (Napata) he had the account of his invasion and
conquest of Egypt cut upon a large grey granite stele about
6 feet high and 4 feet 8 inches wide, and set up in his temple,
among the ruins of which it was discovered accidentally by
an Egyptian officer who was serving in the Egyptian S&#363;d&#257;n
in 1862.</p>

<h3>AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL LITERATURE<br /><br /></h3>


<p>Attention has already been called to the very great importance
of the autobiographies of the military and administrative
officials of the Pharaohs, and a selection of them
must now be given. They are, in many cases, the only
sources of information which we possess about certain wars
and about the social conditions of the periods during which
they were composed, and they often describe events about
which official Egyptian history is altogether silent. Most of
these autobiographies are found cut upon the walls of tombs,
and, though according to modern notions their writers may
seem to have been very conceited, and their language exaggerated
and bombastic, the inscriptions bear throughout
the impress of truth, and the facts recorded in them have
therefore especial value. The narratives are usually simple
and clear, and as long as they deal with matters of fact they
are easily understood, but when the writers describe their
own personal characters and their moral excellences their
meaning is sometimes not plain. Such autobiographies are
sometimes very useful in settling the chronology of a doubtful
period of history, and as an example of such may be
quoted the autobiography of Ptah-shepses, preserved in the
British Museum. This distinguished man was born in the
reign of Menkaur&#257;, the builder of the Third Pyramid at
G&#299;zah, and he was educated with the king's children, being
a great favourite of the king himself. The next king, Shepseskaf,
gave him to wife Ma&#257;tkh&#257;, his eldest daughter, in
order to keep him about the Court. Under the succeeding
kings Userkaf and Sahur&#257; he was advanced to great honour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_127" id="Pg_127" title="Pg_127">[127]</a></span>and he became so great a favourite of the next king, Neferari-kar&#257;,
that he was allowed to kiss the king's foot instead of
the ground on which it rested when he did homage. He
was promoted to further honours by the next king, Neferefr&#257;,
and he lived to see Userenr&#257; ascend the throne. Thus Ptah-shepses
lived under eight kings, and his inscription makes
it possible to arrange their reigns in correct chronological
order.<br /><br /></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Autobiography of Una</span></h3>

<p>This inscription was found cut in hieroglyphs upon a slab
of limestone fixed in Una's tomb at Abydos; it is now in the
Egyptian Museum in Cairo. It reads:</p>

<p>The Duke, the Governor of the South, the judge belonging
to Nekhen, prince of Nekheb, the <i>smer uat</i> vassal
of Osiris Khenti Amenti, Una, saith: "I was a child girded
with a girdle under the Majesty of King Teta. My rank
was that of overseer of tillage (?), and I was deputy inspector
of the estates of Pharaoh.... I was chief of the <i>teb</i> chamber
under the Majesty of Pepi. His Majesty gave me the rank
of <i>smer</i> and deputy priest of his pyramid&mdash;town. Whilst
I held the rank of ... His Majesty made me a 'judge
belonging to Nekhen.' His heart was more satisfied with
me than with any other of his servants. Alone I heard
every kind of private case, there being with me only the
Chief Justice and the Governor of the town ... in the
name of the king, of the royal household, and of the Six Great
Houses. The heart of the king was more satisfied with me
than with any other of his high officials, or any of his nobles,
or any of his servants. I asked the Majesty of [my] Lord
to permit a white stone sarcophagus to be brought for me
from Raau.<a name="FNanchor_1_113" id="FNanchor_1_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_113" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> His Majesty made the keeper of the royal
seal, assisted by a body of workmen, bring this sarcophagus
over from Raau in a barge, and he came bringing with it in
a large boat, which was the property of the king, the cover
of the sarcophagus, the slabs for the door, and the slabs for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_128" id="Pg_128" title="Pg_128">[128]</a></span>the setting of the stele, and a pair of stands for censers (?),
and a tablet for offerings. Never before was the like of this
done for any servant. [He did this for me] because I was
perfect in the heart of His Majesty, because I was acceptable
to the heart of His Majesty, and because the heart of His
Majesty was satisfied with me.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_113" id="Footnote_1_113"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_113"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> On the east bank, opposite Memphis,</p></div>

<p>"Behold, I was 'judge belonging to Nekhen' when His
Majesty made me a <i>smer u&#257;t</i>, and overseer of the estates of
Pharaoh, and ... of the four overseers of the estate of
Pharaoh who were there. I performed my duties in such
a way as to secure His Majesty's approval, both when the
Court was in residence and when it was travelling, and in
appointing officials for duty. I acted in such a way that
His Majesty praised me for my work above everything.
During the secret inquiry which was made in the king's
household concerning the Chief Wife Amtes, His Majesty
made me enter to hear the case by myself. There was no
Chief Justice there, and no Town Governor, and no nobleman,
only myself, and this was because I was able and acceptable
to the heart of His Majesty, and because the heart of
His Majesty was filled with me. I did the case into writing,
I alone, with only one judge belonging to Nekhen, and yet
my rank was only that of overseer of the estates of Pharaoh.
Never before did a man of my rank hear the case of a secret
of the royal household, and His Majesty only made me hear
it because I was more perfect to the heart of His Majesty
than any officer of his, or any nobleman of his, or any servant
of his.</p>

<p>"His Majesty had to put down a revolt of the &#256;amu dwellers
on the sand.<a name="FNanchor_1_114" id="FNanchor_1_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_114" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> His Majesty collected an army of many thousands
strong in the South everywhere, beyond Abu (Elephantine)
and northwards of Aphroditopolis, in the Northland
(Delta) everywhere, in both halves of the region, in Setcher,
and in the towns like Setcher, in Arthet of the Blacks, in
Matcha of the Blacks, in Amam of the Blacks, in Uauat of the
Blacks, in Kaau of the Blacks, and in the Land of Themeh.
His Majesty sent me at the head of this army. Behold, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_129" id="Pg_129" title="Pg_129">[129]</a></span>dukes, the royal seal-bearers, the <i>smer uats</i> of the palace, the
chiefs, the governors of the forts (?) of the South and the
North, the <i>smeru</i>, the masters of caravans, the overseers of
the priests of the South and North, and the overseers of the
stewards, were commanding companies of the South and the
North, and of the forts and towns which they ruled, and of
the Blacks of these countries, but it was I who planned tactics
for them, although my rank was only that of an overseer of the
estates of Pharaoh of.... No one quarrelled with his fellow,
no one stole the food or the sandals of the man on the road,
no one stole bread from any town, and no one stole a goat
from any encampment of people. I despatched them from
North Island, the gate of Ihetep, the U&#257;rt of Heru-neb-Ma&#257;t.
Having this rank ... I investigated (?) each of these companies
(or regiments); never had any servant investigated (?)
companies in this way before. This army returned
in peace, having raided the Land of the dwellers on sand.
This army returned in peace, having thrown down the
fortresses thereof. This army returned in peace, having
cut down its fig-trees and vines. This army returned in
peace, having set fire [to the temples] of all its gods. This
army returned in peace, having slain the soldiers there in
many tens of thousands. This army returned in peace,
bringing back with it vast numbers of the fighting men
thereof as living prisoners. His Majesty praised me for this
exceedingly. His Majesty sent me to lead this army five
times, to raid the Land of the dwellers on sand, whensoever
they rebelled with these companies. I acted in such a way
that His Majesty praised me exceedingly. When it was
reported that there was a revolt among the wild desert
tribes of the Land of Shert<a name="FNanchor_2_115" id="FNanchor_2_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_115" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> ... I set out with these
warriors in large transports, and sailed until I reached the
end of the high land of Thest, to the north of the Land of
the dwellers on sand, and when I had led the army up I advanced
and attacked the whole body of them, and I slew
every rebel among them.</p>

<p>"I was the ... of the Palace, and bearer of the [royal]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_130" id="Pg_130" title="Pg_130">[130]</a></span>sandals, when His Majesty the King of the South and North,
Merenr&#257;, my ever living Lord, made me Duke and Governor
of the South land beyond Abu (Elephantine) and of the district
north of Aphroditopolis, because I was perfect to the
heart of His Majesty, because I was acceptable to the heart
of His Majesty, and because the heart of His Majesty was
satisfied with me. I was ... [of the Palace], and sandal-bearer
when His Majesty praised me for displaying more
watchfulness (or attention) at Court in respect of the appointment
of officials for duty than any of his princes, or
nobles, or servants. Never before was this rank bestowed
on any servant. I performed the duties of Governor of the
South to the satisfaction [of every one]. No one complained
of (or quarrelled with) his neighbour; I carried out work of
every kind. I counted everything that was due to the
Palace in the South twice, and all the labour that was due
to the Palace in the South I counted twice. I served the
office of Prince, ruling as a Prince ought to rule in the South;
the like of this was never before done in the South. I acted
in such a way that His Majesty praised me for it. His
Majesty sent me to the Land of Abhat to bring back a sarcophagus,
"the lord of the living one," with its cover, and a
beautiful and magnificent pyramidion for the Queen's pyramid
[which is called] Kh&#257;nefer Merenr&#257;. His Majesty sent
me to Abu to bring back a granite door and its table for
offerings, with slabs of granite for the stele door and its framework,
and to bring back granite doors and tables for offerings
for the upper room in the Queen's pyramid, Kh&#257;nefer
Merenr&#257;. I sailed down the Nile to the pyramid Kh&#257;nefer
Merenr&#257; with six lighters, and three barges, and three floats(?),
accompanied by one war boat. Never before had any
[official] visited Abhat and Abu with [only] one war boat
since kings have reigned. Whensoever His Majesty gave
an order for anything to be done I carried it out thoroughly
according to the order which His Majesty gave concerning it.</p>

<p>"His Majesty sent me to Het-nub to bring back a great
table for offerings of <i>rutt</i> stone (quartzite sandstone?) of
Het-nub. I made this table for offerings reach him in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_131" id="Pg_131" title="Pg_131">[131]</a></span>seventeen days. It was quarried in Het-nub, and I caused
it to float down the river in a lighter. I cut out the planks
for him in acacia wood, sixty cubits long and thirty cubits
broad; they were put together in seventeen days in the third
month (May-June) of the Summer Season. Behold, though
there was no water in the basins (?) it arrived at the pyramid
Kh&#257;nefer Merenr&#257; in peace. I performed the work throughout
in accordance with the order which the Majesty of my
Lord had given to me. His Majesty sent me to excavate
five canals in the South, and to make three lighters, and four
barges of the acacia wood of Uauat. Behold, the governors
of Arthet, Uauat, and Matcha brought the wood for them,
and I finished the whole of the work in one year. [When]
they were floated they were loaded with huge slabs of granite
for the pyramid Kh&#257;nefer Merenr&#257;; moreover, all of them
were passed through these five canals ... because I ascribed
more majesty, and praise (?), and worship to the Souls of
the King of the South and North, Merenr&#257;, the ever living,
than to any of the gods.... I carried out everything
according to the order which his divine Ka gave me.</p>

<p>"I was a person who was beloved by his father, and praised
by his mother, and gracious to his brethren, I the Duke, a
real Governor<a name="FNanchor_1_116" id="FNanchor_1_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_116" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of the South, the vassal of Osiris, Una."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Autobiography of Herkhuf</span></h3>

<p>This inscription is cut in hieroglyphs upon a slab of stone,
which was originally in the tomb of Herkhuf at Asw&acirc;n, and
is now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and upon parts of
the walls of his tomb. Herkhuf was a Duke, a <i>smer uat</i>, a
Kher-heb priest, a judge belonging to Nekhen, the Lord of
Nekheb, a bearer of the royal seal, the sh&#275;kh of the caravans,
and an administrator of very high rank in the South. All
these titles, and the following lines, together with prayers for
offerings, are cut above the door of his tomb. He says:</p>

<p>"I came this day from my town. I descended from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_132" id="Pg_132" title="Pg_132">[132]</a></span>my nome. I builded a house and set up doors. I dug a
lake and I planted sycamore trees. The King praised me.
My father made a will in my favour. I am perfect....
[I am a person] who is beloved by his father, praised
by his mother, whom all his brethren loved. I gave bread
to the hungry man, raiment to the naked, and him who
had no boat I ferried over the river. O ye living men
and women who are on the earth, who shall pass by this
tomb in sailing down or up the river, and who shall say, 'A
thousand bread-cakes and a thousand vessels of beer to the
lord of this tomb,' I will offer them for you in Khert Nefer
(the Other World). I am a perfect spirit, equipped [with
spells], and a Kher-heb priest whose mouth hath knowledge.
If any young man shall come into this tomb as if it were his
own property I will seize him like a goose, and the Great God
shall pass judgment on him for it. I was a man who spoke
what was good, and repeated what was loved. I never
uttered any evil word concerning servants to a man of power,
for I wished that I might stand well with the Great God. I
never gave a decision in a dispute between brothers which
had the effect of robbing a son of the property of his father."</p>

<p>Herkhuf, the Duke, the <i>smer uat</i>, the chamberlain, the
Judge belonging to Nekhen, the Lord of Nekheb, bearer of

South, the beloved of his Lord, Herkhuf,<a name="FNanchor_1_117" id="FNanchor_1_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_117" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> who bringeth the
things of every desert to his Lord, who bringeth the offering
of royal apparel, governor of the countries of the South, who
setteth the fear of Horus in the lands, who doeth what his

<p>"His Majesty Merenr&#257;, my Lord, sent me with my father
Ara, the <i>smer uat</i> and Kher-heb priest, to the land of Amam
to open up a road into this country. I performed the journey
in seven months. I brought back gifts of all kinds from
that place, making beautiful the region (?); there was very
great praise to me for it. His Majesty sent me a second
time by myself. I started on the road of Abu (Elephantine),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_133" id="Pg_133" title="Pg_133">[133]</a></span>I came back from Arthet, Mekher, Terres, Artheth, in a period
of eight months. I came back and I brought very large
quantities of offerings from this country. Never were
brought such things to this land. I came back from the
house of the Chief of Setu and Arthet, having opened up
these countries. Never before had any <i>smer</i> or governor of
the caravan who had appeared in the country of Amam opened
up a road. Moreover, His Majesty sent me a third time to
Amam. I started from ... on the Uhat road, and I found
the Governor of Amam was then marching against the Land
of Themeh, to fight the Themeh, in the western corner of
the sky. I set out after him to the Land of Themeh, and
made him to keep the peace, whereupon he praised all the
gods for the King (of Egypt). [Here follow some broken
lines.] I came back from Amam with three hundred asses
laden with incense, ebony, <i>heknu</i>, grain, panther skins,
ivory, ... boomerangs, and valuable products of every
kind. When the Chief of Arthet, Setu, and Uauat saw the
strength and great number of the warriors of Amam who
had come back with me to the Palace, and the soldiers who
had been sent with me, this chief brought out and gave to
me bulls, and sheep, and goats. And he guided me on the
roads of the plains of Arthet, because I was more perfect, and
more watchful (or alert) than any other <i>smer</i> or governor
of a caravan who had ever been despatched to Amam. And
when the servant (<i>i.e.</i> Herkhuf) was sailing down the river
to the capital (or Court) the king made the duke, the <i>smer
uat,</i> the overseer of the bath, Khuna (or Una) sail up the
river with boats loaded with date wine, <i>mesuq</i> cakes,
bread-cakes, and beer."<a name="FNanchor_1_118" id="FNanchor_1_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_118" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_118" id="Footnote_1_118"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_118"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Herkhuf's titles are here repeated.</p></div>

<p>Herkhuf made a fourth journey into the S&#363;d&#257;n, and when
he came back he reported his successes to the new king,
Pepi II, and told him that among other remarkable things
he had brought back from Amam a dancing dwarf, or pygmy.
The king then wrote a letter to Herkhuf and asked him to
send the dwarf to him in Memphis. The text of this letter
Herkhuf had cut on the front of his tomb, and it reads thus:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_134" id="Pg_134" title="Pg_134">[134]</a></span>Royal seal. The fifteenth day of the third month of the
Season Akhet (Sept.-Oct.) of the second year. Royal
despatch to the <i>smer uat</i>, the Kher-heb priest, the governor
of the caravan, Herkhuf. I have understood the words of
this letter which thou hast made to the king in his chamber
to make him to know that thou hast returned in peace from
Amam, together with the soldiers who were with thee. Thou
sayest in this thy letter that there have been brought back
by thee great and beautiful offerings of all kinds, which
Hathor, the Lady of Ammaau, hath given to the divine Ka
of the King of the South and North, Neferkar&#257;, the everliving,
for ever. Thou sayest in this thy letter that there
hath been brought back by thee [also] a pygmy (or dwarf)
who can dance the dance of the god, from the Land of the
Spirits, like the pygmy whom the seal-bearer of the god
Baurtet brought back from Punt in the time of Assa. Thou
sayest to [my] Majesty, "The like of him hath never been
brought back by any other person who hath visited Amam."
Behold, every year thou performest what thy Lord wisheth
and praiseth. Behold, thou passest thy days and thy nights
meditating about doing what thy Lord ordereth, and wisheth,
and praiseth. And His Majesty will confer on thee so many
splendid honours, which shall give renown to thy grandson
for ever, that all the people shall say when they have heard
what [my] Majesty hath done for thee, "Was there ever
anything like this that hath been done for the <i>smer uat</i>
Herkhuf when he came back from Amam because of the
sagacity (or attention) which he displayed in doing what
his Lord commanded, and wished for, and praised?" Come
down the river at once to the Capital. Bring with thee this
pygmy whom thou hast brought from the Land of the
Spirits, alive, strong, and healthy, to dance the dance of the
god, and to cheer and gratify the heart of the King of
the South and North, Neferkar&#257;, the everliving. When
he cometh down with thee in the boat, cause trustworthy
men to be about him on both sides of the boat, to prevent
him from falling into the water. When he is asleep at night
cause trustworthy men to sleep by his side on his bedding.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_135" id="Pg_135" title="Pg_135">[135]</a></span>See [that he is there] ten times [each] night. [My] Majesty
wisheth to see this pygmy more than any offering of the
countries of Ba and Punt. If when thou arrivest at the
Capital, this pygmy who is with thee is alive, and strong,
and in good health, [My] Majesty will confer upon thee a
greater honour than that which was conferred upon the
bearer of the seal Baurtet in the time of Assa, and as great
is the wish of [My] Majesty to see this pygmy orders have
been brought to the <i>smer</i>, the overseer of the priests, the
governor of the town ... to arrange that rations for him
shall be drawn from every station of supply, and from
every temple without....<br /><br /></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Autobiography of Ameni Amenemh&#257;t</span></h3>

<p>This inscription is cut in hieroglyphs on the doorposts of
the tomb of Ameni at Beni-hasan in Upper Egypt. It is
dated in the forty-third year of the reign of Usertsen I, a
king of the twelfth dynasty, about 2400 B.C. After giving
the date and a list of his titles, Ameni says:</p>

<p>"I followed my Lord when he sailed to the South to overthrow
his enemies in the four countries of Nubia. I sailed
to the south as the son of a duke, and as a bearer of the royal
seal, and as a captain of the troops of the Nome of Mehetch,
and as a man who took the place of his aged father, according
to the favour which he enjoyed in the king's house and the
love that was his at Court. I passed through Kash in sailing
to the South. I set the frontier of Egypt further southwards,
I brought back offerings, and the praise of me reached
the skies. His Majesty set out and overthrew his enemies
in the vile land of Kash. I returned, following him as an
alert official. There was no loss among my soldiers. [And
again] I sailed to the South to fetch gold ore for the Majesty
of the King of the South, the King of the North, Kheperkar&#257;
(Usertsen I), the ever living. I sailed to the south with
the Erp&#257; and Duke, the eldest son of the king, of his body
Ameni.<a name="FNanchor_1_119" id="FNanchor_1_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_119" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> I sailed to the south with a company of four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_136" id="Pg_136" title="Pg_136">[136]</a></span>hundred chosen men from my troops; they returned in safety,
none of them having been lost. I brought back the gold which
I was expected to bring, and I was praised for it in the house
of the king; the prince [Ameni] praised God for me. [And
again] I sailed to the south to bring back gold ore to the
town of Qebti (Coptos) with the Erp&#257;, the Duke, the governor
of the town, and the chief officer of the Government,
Usertsen, life, strength, health [be to him!]. I sailed to the
south with a company of six hundred men, every one being
a mighty man of war of the Nome of Mehetch. I returned
in peace, with all my soldiers in good health (or safe), having
performed everything which I had been commanded to do.
I was a man who was of a conciliatory disposition, one whose
love [for his fellows] was abundant, and I was a governor
who loved his town. I passed [many] years as governor of
the Mehetch Nome. All the works (<i>i.e.</i> the forced labour)
due to the palace were performed under my direction. The
overseers of the chiefs of the districts of the herdsmen of the
Nome of Mehetch gave me three thousand bulls, together
with their gear for ploughing, and I was praised because of
it in the king's house every year of making [count] of the
cattle. I took over all the products of their works to the
king's house, and there were no liabilities against me in any
house of the king. I worked the Nome of Mehetch to its
farthest limit, travelling frequently [through it]. No peasant's
daughter did I harm, no widow did I wrong, no field
labourer did I oppress, no herdsman did I repulse. I did
not seize the men of any master of five field labourers for the
forced labour (corv&eacute;e). There was no man in abject want
during the period of my rule, and there was no man hungry
in my time. When years of hunger came, I rose up and had
ploughed all the fields of the Nome of Mehetch, as far as
it extended to the south and to the north, [thus] keeping
alive its people, and providing the food thereof, and there
was no hungry man therein. I gave to the widow as to the
woman who possessed a husband. I made no distinction
between the elder and the younger in whatsoever I gave.
When years of high Nile floods came, the lords (<i>i.e.</i> the producers)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_137" id="Pg_137" title="Pg_137">[137]</a></span>of wheat and barley, the lords of products of every
kind, I did not cut off (or deduct) what was due on the land
[from the years of low Nile floods], I Ameni, the vassal of
Horus, the Smiter of the Rekhti,<a name="FNanchor_2_120" id="FNanchor_2_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_120" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> generous of hand, stable
of feet, lacking avarice because of his love for his town,
learned in traditions (?), who appeareth at the right moment,
without thought of guile, the vassal of Khnemu, highly
favoured in the king's house, who boweth before ambassadors,
who performeth the behests of the nobles, speaker
of the truth, who judgeth righteously between two litigants,
free from the word of deceit, skilled in the methods of the
council chamber, who discovereth the solution of a difficult
question, Ameni.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Autobiography of Thetha</span></h3>

<p>This inscription is cut in hieroglyphs upon a large rectangular
slab of limestone now preserved in the British
Museum (No. 100). It belongs to the period of the eleventh
dynasty, when texts of the kind are very rare, and was made
in the reign of Uah&#257;nkh, or Antef. It reads:</p>

<p>Thetha, the servant in truth of the Horus Uah&#257;nkh, the
King of the South, the King of the North, the son of R&#257;,
Antef, the doer of beneficent acts, living like R&#257; for ever,
beloved by him from the bottom of his heart, holder of the
chief place in the house of his lord, the great noble of his
heart, who knoweth the matters of the heart of his lord, who
attendeth him in all his goings, one in heart with His Majesty
in very truth, the leader of the great men of the house of the
king, the bearer of the royal seal in the seat of confidential
affairs, keeping close the counsel of his lord more than the
chiefs, who maketh to rejoice the Horus (<i>i.e.</i> the king)
through what he wisheth, the favourite of his Lord, beloved
by him as the mouth of the seal, the president of the place
of confidential affairs, whom his lord loveth, the mouth of
the seal, the chief after the king, the vassal, saith:</p>

<p>I was the beloved one of his Lord, I was he with whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_138" id="Pg_138" title="Pg_138">[138]</a></span>he was well pleased all day and every day. I passed a long
period of my life [that is] years, under the Majesty of my
Lord, the Horus, Uah&#257;nkh, the King of the South and North,
the son of the Sun, Antef. Behold, this country was subject
unto him in the south as far as Thes, and in the north as far
as Abtu of Then (Abydos of This). Behold, I was in the
position of body servant of his, and was an actual chief under
him. He magnified me, and he made my position to be one
of great prominence, and he set me in the place beloved (?)
for the affairs of his heart, in his palace. Because of the
singleness [of my heart] he appointed me to be a bearer of
the royal seal, and the deputy of the registrary (?). [I]
selected the good things of all kinds of the offerings brought
to the Majesty of my Lord, from the South and from the
North land whensoever a taxing was made, and I made him
to rejoice at the assessment which was made everywhere
throughout the country. Now His Majesty had been afraid
that the tribute, which was brought to His Majesty, my Lord,
from the princes who were the overlords of the Red Country
(Lower Egypt), would dwindle away in this country, and he
had been afraid that the same would be the case in the other
countries also. He committed to me these matters, for he
knew that my administration was able. I rendered to him
information about them, and because of my great knowledge
of affairs never did anything escape that was not replaced.
I was one who lived in the heart of his Lord, in very truth,
and I was a great noble after his own heart. I was as cool
water and fire in the house of my Lord. The shoulders of
the great ones bent [before me]. I did not thrust myself
in the train of the wicked, for which men are hated. I was
a lover of what was good, and a hater of what was evil. My
disposition was that of one beloved in the house of my Lord.
I carried out every course of action in accordance with the
urgency that was in the heart of my Lord. Moreover, in
the matter of every affair which His Majesty caused me to
follow out, if any official obstructed me in truth I overthrew
his opposition. I neither resisted his order, nor hesitated,
but I carried it out in very truth. In making any computation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_139" id="Pg_139" title="Pg_139">[139]</a></span>which he ordered, I made no mistake. I did not set
one thing in the place of another. I did not increase the
flame of his wrath in its strength. I did not filch property
from an inheritance. Moreover, as concerning all that His
Majesty commanded to set before him in respect of the royal
household (or <i>harim</i>), I kept accounts of everything which
His Majesty desired, and I gave them unto him, and I made
satisfactory all their statements. Because of the greatness
of my knowledge nothing ever escaped me.</p>

<p>I made a <i>mekha</i> boat for my town, and a <i>sehi</i> boat, so that
I might attend in the train of my Lord, and I was one of the
number of the great ones on every occasion when travel or
journeying had to be performed, and I was held in great
esteem, and entreated most honourably. I provided my
own equipment from the possessions which His Majesty,
the Horus Uah&#257;nkh, the King of the South, the King of the
North, the son of the Sun, Antef, who liveth like R&#257; for ever,
gave unto me because of the greatness of his love for me,
until he departed in peace to his horizon (<i>i.e.</i> the tomb).
And when his son, that is to say, the Horus Nekhtneb-Tepnefer,
the King of the South, the King of the North, the son
of R&#257;, Antef, the producer of beneficent acts, who liveth
for ever like R&#257;, entered his house, I followed him as his
body-companion into all his beautiful places that rejoiced
[his] heart, and because of the greatness of my knowledge
there was never anything wanting (?). He committed to
me and gave into my hand every duty that had been mine
in the time of his father, and I performed it effectively under
His Majesty; no matter connected with any duty escaped
me. I lived the [remainder] of my days on the earth near
the King, and was the chief of his body-companions. I was
great and strong under His Majesty, and I performed everything
which he decreed. I was one who was pleasing to
his Lord all day and every day.<br /><br /></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Autobiography of Aahmes (Amasis), the
Naval Officer</span></h3>

<p>This inscription is cut in hieroglyphs on the walls of the
tomb of Aahmes at Al-K&#257;b in Upper Egypt; this distinguished
marine flourished in the reigns of the first kings of
the eighteenth dynasty, about 1600 B.C. The text reads:</p>

<p>The captain of the transport men, Aahmes, the son of
Abana, the truth-speaker, saith: O all men, I will declare
unto you, and will inform you concerning the favours that
were conferred upon me. Seven times was I given gold in
the sight of the whole land, and likewise slaves, both male
and female, and grants of land for estates to be held by me
in perpetuity were also made to me. Thus the name of a
man bold and brave in his deeds shall not be extinguished
in this land for ever! He saith:</p>

<p>I passed my childhood in the town of Nekheb (Eileithyiaspolis,
Al-K&#257;b). My father was a soldier in the army of the
King of the South, the King of the North, Seqenn-R&#257;,
whose word is truth; Baba was his name, and he was the
son of Reant. I performed military service as his substitute
in the ship called the <i>Bull</i> in the reign of the Lord of
the Two Lands, Nebpehtir&#257; (Amasis I), whose word is truth.
I was at that time a youth, and was unmarried, and I slept
in the <i>shennu</i>. Afterwards I got a house (<i>i.e.</i> wife) for myself,
and I was drafted off to a ship, the "North" (?), because of
my bravery. Then it became my lot to follow after the king,
life, strength, health [be to him!], on my feet whensoever
he made a journey in his chariot. The king sat down (<i>i.e.</i>
besieged) before the city of Hetu&#257;rt (Avaris), and it was my
lot whilst I was on my two feet to do a deed of bravery in
the presence of His Majesty, whereupon I was made an officer
in the vessel [called] <i>Kh&#257;-em-Mennefer.</i> The king was fighting
on the arm of the river of Avaris [called] Patchetku, and
I rose up and engaged in the fight, and I brought back a
hand.<a name="FNanchor_1_121" id="FNanchor_1_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_121" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The royal herald proclaimed the matter, and the
king gave me the gift of gold [which was awarded] for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_141" id="Pg_141" title="Pg_141">[141]</a></span>bravery. The fighting was renewed at this place (<i>i.e.</i> Avaris),
and I again joined in the fight, and I brought back a hand;
and the king gave me the gift of gold [which was awarded]
for bravery a second time.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_121" id="Footnote_1_121"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_121"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> He had cut it off from a vanquished foe.</p></div>

<p>Then the king fought a battle in Egypt, to the south of
this place, and I made prisoner a man and brought him back
alive; I went down into the water<a name="FNanchor_1_122" id="FNanchor_1_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_122" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and brought him along
on the road to the town, being firmly bound, and I crossed
the water with him in a boat. The royal herald proclaimed
[this act], and indeed I was rewarded with a double portion
of the gold [which is awarded] for bravery. Then the king
captured Avaris, and I brought back prisoners from the
town, one man and three women, in all four persons. His
Majesty gave these to me for slaves. Then His Majesty
sat down before (<i>i.e.</i> besieged) Sharhana<a name="FNanchor_2_123" id="FNanchor_2_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_123" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in the fifth year,
and captured it. I brought back from thence two persons,
women, and one hand. And the king gave me the gift of
gold [awarded] for bravery, as well as the two prisoners for
slaves.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_122" id="Footnote_1_122"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_122"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The water of the arm of the Nile.</p></div>

<p>Now after His Majesty had smitten the Mentiu of Satet<a name="FNanchor_1_124" id="FNanchor_1_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_124" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>,
he sailed up the river to Khenthennefer to crush the Antiu
of Sti<a name="FNanchor_2_125" id="FNanchor_2_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_125" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, and His Majesty overthrew them completely, and
slew very many of them. I rose up and made three prisoners,
viz. two men, alive, and three hands. And the king rewarded
me with a double portion of gold, and he gave me the two
prisoners to be my slaves. Returning His Majesty sailed
down the river. His heart was expanded with the bravery
of strength, for he had [now] conquered the Lands of the
South [as well as] the Lands of the North. [Then as for]
Aatti, the accursed one, who came from the South, his destiny
came upon him, and he perished. The gods of the South
laid their hands upon him, and His Majesty found him in
Thentta&#257;mu (?). His Majesty brought him back bound alive,
and with him were all his people loaded with fetters. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_142" id="Pg_142" title="Pg_142">[142]</a></span>captured two of the soldiers of the enemy, and I brought
them back, firmly fettered, from the boat of the foe Aatti.
And the king gave me five men and parcels of land, five
<i>stat</i> [in area] in my city. This was likewise done for the
sailors, one and all. Then that vanquished foe came, Teta&#257;n
(the accursed one!) was his name, and he had gathered
together round about himself men with hearts hostile [to
the king]. His Majesty smote him and his accursed servants,
and they ceased to exist. His Majesty gave me three
men and a parcel of land five <i>stat</i> [in area] in my town.</p>

<p>I transported the King of the South, the King of the
North, Tcheserkar&#257; (Amenhetep I), whose word is truth,
when he sailed up the river to Kash (Cush, Nubia) to extend
towards the south the frontiers of Egypt. His Majesty
captured that accursed Anti of Nubia in the midst of his
accursed bowmen; he was brought back, fettered by the
neck, and they could not escape. [They were] deported,
and were not allowed [to remain] upon [their] own land,
and they became as if they existed not. And behold, I was
at the head of our bowmen! I fought with all my strength
and might, and His Majesty saw my bravery. I brought back
two hands and carried them to His Majesty. And the king
went and raided men, women, and cattle, and I rose up and
captured a prisoner and brought him alive to His Majesty.
I brought back His Majesty from Khnemet-heru,<a name="FNanchor_1_126" id="FNanchor_1_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_126" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and the
king gave me a gift of gold. I brought back alive two
women whom I had captured in addition to those I had
already carried to His Majesty, and the king appointed me
to be "&#256;hatiu-en-Heq" (<i>i.e.</i> "Warrior of the Princes," or
"Crown-warrior"). I transported the King of the South,
the King of the North, &#256;akheperkar&#257;, whose word is truth,
when he sailed up the river to Khent-hen-nefer, to put down
the rebellion in Khet land, and to put an end to the incursions
of the people of Asemt. I fought with great bravery
in his presence in the troubled water during the towing (?)
of the fighting barges over the rapids(?), and the king made
me the "Captain of the Transport." His Majesty, life,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_143" id="Pg_143" title="Pg_143">[143]</a></span>strength, health [be to him!] ... raged like a panther, he
shot his first arrow, [which] remained in the neck of the
vanquished foe ... [the enemies] were helpless before the
flaming serpent on his crown; [thus] were they made in the
hour of defeat and slaughter, and their slaves were brought
back prisoners alive. Returning His Majesty sailed down
the river having all the mountains and deserts in his hand.
And that accursed Anti of Nubia was hung up head downwards,
at the prow of the boat of His Majesty, and [then]
placed on the ground in the Apts (<i>i.e.</i> Karnak). After these
things the king set out on an expedition against Rethenu
(Northern Syria), to avenge himself on foreign lands. His
Majesty went forth against Neharina, where he found that
the wretched enemy had set his warriors in battle array.
His Majesty defeated them with great slaughter, and those
who were captured alive and brought back by him from his
wars could not be counted. And behold, I was the captain
of our soldiers, and His Majesty saw my deeds of might. I
brought out of the fight a chariot with its horses, and he
who had been driving it was fettered prisoner inside it, and
I carried them to His Majesty, who gave me a gift of gold,
a twofold portion. Then I waxed old, and I arrived at a
great age, and the favours [bestowed upon] me were as [many
as those] at the beginning [of my life] ... a tomb in the
mountain which I myself have made.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Autobiography of Aahmes (Amasis), Surnamed
Pen-Nekheb</span></h3>

<p>This inscription is cut in hieroglyphs upon the walls of the
tomb of Aahmes at Al-K&#257;b in Upper Egypt. Aahmes was
a contemporary of Aahmes the transport officer, and served
under several of the early kings of the eighteenth dynasty.
The text reads:</p>

<p>The Erp&#257;, the Duke, the bearer of the seal, the man who
took prisoners with his own hands, Aahmes, saith: I accompanied
the King of the South, the King of the North, Nebpehtir&#257;
(Amasis I), whose word is truth, and I captured for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_144" id="Pg_144" title="Pg_144">[144]</a></span>him in Tchah (Syria) one prisoner alive and one hand. I
accompanied the King of the South, the King of the North,
Tcheserkar&#257;, whose word is truth, and I captured for him
in Kash (Nubia) one prisoner alive. On another occasion
I captured for him three hands to the north of Aukehek. I
accompanied the King of the South, the King of the North,
whose word is truth, and I captured for him two prisoners
alive, in addition to the three other prisoners who were alive,
and who escaped (?) from me in Kash, and were not counted
by me. And on another occasion I laboured for him, and I
captured for him in the country of Neherina (Mesopotamia)
twenty-one hands, one horse, and one chariot. I accompanied
the King of the South, the King of the North, &#256;akheperenr&#257;,
whose word is law, and I brought away as tribute
a very large number of the Shasu<a name="FNanchor_1_127" id="FNanchor_1_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_127" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> alive, but I did not count
them. I accompanied the Kings of the South, the Kings of
the North, [those great] gods, and I was with them in the
countries of the South and North, and in every place where
they went, namely, King Nebpehtir&#257; (Amasis I), King
Tcheserkar&#257; (Amenhetep I), &#256;akheperkar&#257; (Thothmes I),
&#256;akheperenr&#257; (Thothmes II), and this beneficent god Menkheperr&#257;<a name="FNanchor_2_128" id="FNanchor_2_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_128" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
(Thothmes III), who is endowed with life for ever.
I have reached a good old age, I have lived with kings, I
have enjoyed favours under their Majesties, and affection
hath been shown to me in the Palace, life, strength, health
[be to them!]. The divine wife, the chief royal wife Ma&#257;tkar&#257;,
whose word is truth, showed several favours to me. I
held in my arms her eldest daughter, the Princess Neferur&#257;,
whose word is law, when she was a nursling, I the bearer of
the royal seal, who captured my prisoners, Aahmes, who am
surnamed Pen-Nekheb, did this. I was never absent from
the king at the time of fighting, beginning with Nebpehtir&#257;
(Amasis I), and continuing until the reign of Menkheperr&#257;
(Thothmes III). Tcheserkar&#257; (Amenhetep I) gave me in gold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_145" id="Pg_145" title="Pg_145">[145]</a></span>two rings, two collars, one armlet, one dagger, one fan, and
one pectoral (?). &#256;akheperkar&#257; (Thothmes I) gave me in
gold four hand rings, four collars, one armlet, six flies, three
lions, two axe-heads. &#256;akheperenr&#257; gave me in gold four
hand rings, six collars, three armlets (?), one plaque, and in
silver two axe-heads.</p>

<h3>THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF TEHUTI, THE ERP&#256;</h3>

<p>The autobiographies given hitherto are those of soldiers,
sailors, and officials who in the performance of their duties
travelled in Nubia, the Egyptian S&#363;d&#257;n, the Eastern S&#363;d&#257;n,
the Red Sea Littoral, Sinai, and Western Asia. The following
autobiography is that of one of the great nobles, who in
the eighteenth dynasty assisted in carrying out the great
building schemes of Queen H&#257;tshepset and Thothmes III.
Tehuti was an hereditary chief (<i>erp&#257;</i>), and a Duke, and the
Director of the Department of the Government in which
all the gold and silver that were brought to Thebes as tribute
were kept, and he controlled the distribution of the same in
connection with the Public Works Department. The text
begins with the words of praise to Amen-R&#257; for the life of
H&#257;tshepset and of Thothmes III, thus: "Thanks be to
Amen-[R&#257;, the King of the Gods], and praise be to His Majesty
when he riseth in the eastern sky for the life, strength, and
health of the King of the South, the King of the North,
Ma&#257;tkar&#257; (H&#257;tshepset), and of the King of the South, the
King of the North, Menkheperr&#257; (Thothmes III), who are
endowed with life, stability, serenity, and health like R&#257;
for ever. I performed the office of chief mouth (<i>i.e.</i> director),
giving orders. I directed the artificers who were engaged
on the work of the great boat of the head of the river [called]
Userhatamen. It was inlaid (or overlaid) with the very
best gold of the mountains, the splendour of which illumined
all Egypt, and it was made by the King of the South, the King
of the North, Ma&#257;tkar&#257;,<a name="FNanchor_1_129" id="FNanchor_1_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_129" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in connection with the monuments
which he made for his father Amen-R&#257;, Lord of the Thrones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_146" id="Pg_146" title="Pg_146">[146]</a></span>of the Two Lands, who is endowed with life like R&#257; for ever.
I performed the office of chief mouth, giving orders. I directed
the artificers who were engaged on the work of the God-house,
the horizon of the god, and on the work of the great
throne, which was [made] of the very best silver-gold<a name="FNanchor_2_130" id="FNanchor_2_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_130" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of
the mountains, and of perfect work to last for ever, which
was made by Ma&#257;tkar&#257; in connection with the monuments
which he made for his father Amen-R&#257;, &amp;c. I performed
the office of chief mouth, giving orders. I directed the artificers
who were engaged on the work of the shrine (?) of Truth,
the framework of the doors of which was of silver-gold, made
by Ma&#257;tkar&#257;, &amp;c. I performed the office of chief mouth,
giving orders. I directed the artificers who were engaged on
the works of Tcheser-Tcheseru,<a name="FNanchor_3_131" id="FNanchor_3_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_131" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the Temple of Millions of
Years, the great doors of which were made of copper inlaid
with figures in silver-gold, which was made by Ma&#257;tkar&#257;,
&amp;c. I performed the office of chief mouth, giving orders. I
directed the artificers who were engaged on the work of
Kh&#257;khut, the great sanctuary of Amen, his horizon in Amen-tet,
whereof all the doors [were made] of real cedar wood
inlaid (or overlaid) with bronze, made by Ma&#257;tkar&#257;, &amp;c. I
performed the office of chief mouth, giving orders. I directed
the artificers who were engaged on the works of the House of
Amen, it shall flourish to all eternity! whereof the pavement
was inlaid with blocks of gold and silver, and its beauties
were like unto those of the horizon of heaven, made by Ma&#257;tkar&#257;,
&amp;c. I performed the office of chief mouth, giving
orders. I directed the artificers who were engaged on the
work of the great shrine, which was made of ebony from
Kenset (Nubia), with a broad, high base, having steps, made
of translucent alabaster [from the quarry] of Het-nub, made
by Ma&#257;tkar&#257;, &amp;c. I performed the office of chief mouth,
giving orders. I directed the artificers who were engaged on
the works of the Great House of the god, which was plated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_147" id="Pg_147" title="Pg_147">[147]</a></span>with silver in which figures were inlaid in gold&mdash;its splendour
lighted up the faces of all who beheld it&mdash;made by Ma&#257;tkar&#257;,
&amp;c. I performed the office of chief mouth, giving orders.
I directed the artificers who were engaged on the work of
the great broad, high doors of the temple of Karnak, which
were covered with plates of copper inlaid with figures in
silver-gold, made by Ma&#257;tkar&#257;, &amp;c. I performed the office
of chief mouth, giving orders. I directed the artificers who
were engaged on the work of the holy necklaces and pectorals,
and on the large talismans of the great sanctuary, which were
made of silver-gold and many different kinds of precious
stones, made by Ma&#257;tkar&#257;, &amp;c. I performed the office of
chief mouth, giving orders. I directed the artificers who
were engaged on the works in connection with the two great
obelisks, [each of which] was one hundred and eight cubits in
height (about 162 feet) and was plated with silver-gold, the
brilliance whereof filled all Egypt, made by Ma&#257;tkar&#257;, &amp;c. I
performed the office of chief mouth, giving orders. I directed
the artificers who were engaged on the work of the holy gate
[called] "Amen-shefit," which was made of a single slab of
copper, and of the images (?) that belonged thereto, made by
Ma&#257;tkar&#257;, &amp;c. I directed the artificers who were engaged on
the work of the altar-stands of Amen. These were made of an
incalculable quantity of silver-gold, set with precious stones,
by Ma&#257;tkar&#257;, &amp;c. I directed the artificers who were engaged
on the work of the store-chests, which were plated with
copper and silver-gold and inlaid with precious stones, made
by Ma&#257;tkar&#257;, &amp;c. I directed the artificers who were engaged
on the works of the Great Throne, and the God-house, which
is built of granite and shall last like the firmly fixed pillars
of the sky, made by Ma&#257;tkar&#257;, &amp;c.</p>

<p>And as for the wonderful things, and all the products of
all the countries, and the best of the wonderful products of
Punt, which His Majesty presented to Amen, Lord of the
Apts, for the life, strength, and health of His Majesty, and
with which he filled the house of this holy god, for Amen had
given him Egypt because he knew that he would rule it
wisely (?), behold, it was I who registered them, because I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_148" id="Pg_148" title="Pg_148">[148]</a></span>was of strict integrity. My favour was permanent before
[His Majesty], it never diminished, and he conferred more
distinctions on me than on any other official about him, for
he knew my integrity in respect of him. He knew that I
carried out works, and that I covered my mouth (<i>i.e.</i> held
my tongue) concerning the affairs of his palace. He made
me the director of his palace, knowing that I was experienced
in affairs. I held the seal of the Two Treasuries, and of the
store of all the precious stones of every kind that were in
the God-house of Amen in the Apts,<a name="FNanchor_1_132" id="FNanchor_1_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_132" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which were filled up
to their roofs with the tribute paid to the god. Such a thing
never happened before, even from the time of the primeval
god. His Majesty commanded to be made a silver-gold ...
for the Great Hall of the festivals. [The metal] was weighed
by the <i>heqet</i> measure for Amen, before all the people, and it
was estimated to contain 88&frac12; <i>heqet</i> measures, which were
equal to 8592&frac12; <i>teben</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_133" id="FNanchor_2_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_133" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It was offered to the god for the life,
strength, and health of Ma&#257;tkar&#257;, the ever living. I received
the <i>sennu</i> offerings which were made to Amen-R&#257;, Lord of
the Apts; these things, all of them, took place in very truth,
and I exaggerate not. I was vigilant, and my heart was
perfect in respect of my lord, for I wish to rest in peace in the
mountain of the spirit-bodies who are in the Other World
(Khert-Neter). I wish my memory to be perpetuated on
the earth. I wish my soul to live before the Lord of Eternity.
I wish that the doorkeepers of the gates of the Tuat (Other
World) may not repulse my soul, and that it may come forth
at the call of him that shall lay offerings in my tomb, that it
may have bread in abundance and ale in full measure, and
that it may drink of the water from the source of the river.
I would go in and come out like the Spirits who do what the
gods wish, that my name may be held in good repute by the
people who shall come in after years, and that they may
praise me at the two seasons (morning and evening) when
they praise the god of my city.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Autobiography of Thaiemhetep, the Daughter
of Her&#257;nkh</span></h3>

<p>This remarkable inscription is found on a stele which is
preserved in the British Museum (No. 1027), and which was
made in the ninth year of King Ptolemy Philopator Philadelphus
(71 B.C.). The text opens with a prayer to all the
great gods of Memphis for funerary offerings, and after a
brief address to her husband's colleagues, Thaiemhetep
describes in detail the principal incidents of her life, and gives
the dates of her birth, death, &amp;c., which are rarely found on
the funerary stel&aelig; of the older period. Thaiemhetep was
an important member of the semi-royal, great high-priestly
family of Memphis, and her funerary inscription throws
much light on the theology of the Ptolemaic Period.</p>

tambourine woman of Ptah, the great one of his South Wall,
the Lord of &#256;nkh-taui, whose word (or voice) is truth.</p>

<p>"And the heart of the Ur-kherp-hem rejoiced in her exceedingly.
I bore to him a child three times, but I did not
bear a man child besides these three daughters. And I and
the Ur-kherp-hem prayed to 9. the Majesty of this holy god,
who [worketh] great wonders and bestoweth happiness (?),
who giveth a son to him that hath one not, and Imhetep, the
son of Ptah, hearkened unto our words, and he accepted his
prayers. And the Majesty of this god came unto this Ur-kherp-hem
during [his] sleep, and said unto him, 10. 'Let
there be built a great building in the form of a large hall [for
the lord of] &#256;nkh-taui, in the place where his body is wrapped
up (or concealed), and in return for this I will give thee a man
child.' And the Ur-kherp-hem woke up out of his sleep after
these [words], and he smelt the ground before this holy god.
And he laid them (<i>i.e.</i> the words) before the priests, 11. and
the chief of the mysteries, and the libationers, and the artisans
of the House of Gold, at one time, and he despatched them
to make the building perfect in the form of a large, splendid
funerary hall. And they did everything according as he
had said. And he performed the ceremony of 'Opening the
Mouth' for this holy god, and he made to him a great offering
of the beautiful offerings of every kind, and he bestowed
upon him sculptured images 12. for the sake of this god, and
he made happy their hearts with offerings of all kinds in
return for this [promise].</p>

<p>"Then I conceived a man child, and I brought him forth
on the <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'fifteeenth'">fifteenth</ins> day of the third month<a name="FNanchor_7_140" id="FNanchor_7_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_140" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of the season

Cleopatra, Life, Strength, Health [be to her!], 13. [the day] of
the festival of 'things on the altar' of this holy god, Imhetep,
the son of Ptah, his form being like unto that of the son of
Him that is south of his wall (<i>i.e.</i> Ptah), great rejoicings on
account of him were made by the inhabitants of White Wall
(Memphis), and there were given to him his name of Imhetep
and the surname of Peta-Bast, and all the people rejoiced
in him. 14.</p>

<p>"The sixteenth day of the second month<a name="FNanchor_8_141" id="FNanchor_8_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_141" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> of the season
Pert of the tenth year was the day on which I died. My
husband, the priest and divine father of Ptah, the priest of
Osiris, Lord of Rastau, the priest of the King of the South,
the King of the North, the Lord of the Two Lands, Ptolemy,
whose word is truth, the chief of the mysteries of the House
of Ptah, the chief of the mysteries of heaven, earth, and the
Other World, the chief of the mysteries of Rastau, the chief
of the mysteries of R&#257;qet, the Ur-kherp-hem, Pa-sher-en-Ptah,
placed me in Am-urtet, 15. he performed for me all the rites
and ceremonies which are [performed] for the dead who are
buried in a fitting manner, he had me made into a beautiful
mummy, and caused me to be laid to rest in his tomb behind
R&#257;qet.</p>

<p>"Hail, brother, husband, friend! O Ur-kherp-hem,
cease not to drink, to eat, to drink wine, 16. to enjoy the love
of women, and to pass thy days happily; follow thy heart
(or desire) day and night. Set not sorrow in thy heart, for
oh, are the years [which we pass] so many on the earth [that
we should do this]? For Amentet is a land where black
darkness cannot be pierced by the eye, and it is a place of
restraint (or misery) for him that dwelleth therein. The
holy ones [who are there] sleep in their forms. They wake
not 17. up to look upon their friends, they see not their
fathers [and] their mothers, and their heart hath no desire
for their wives [and] their children. The living water of the
earth is for those who are on it, stagnant water is for me.
It cometh 18. to him that is upon the earth. Stagnant is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_154" id="Pg_154" title="Pg_154">[154]</a></span>the water which is for me. I know not the place wherein
I am. Since I arrived at this valley of the dead I long for
running water. I say, 'Let not my attendant remove the
pitcher from the stream.' 19. O that one would turn my
face to the north wind on the bank of the stream, and I cry
out for it to cool the pain that is in my heart. He whose
name is 'Arniau'<a name="FNanchor_9_142" id="FNanchor_9_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_142" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> calleth everyone to him, and they come
to him with quaking hearts, and they are terrified through
their fear of him. 20. By him is no distinction made between
gods and men, with him princes are even as men of no account.
His hand is not turned away from all those who love him,
for he snatcheth away the babe from his mother's [breast]
even as he doth the aged man. He goeth about on his way,
and all men fear him, and [though] they make supplication
before him, he turneth not his face away from them. Useless
is it to make entreaty to him, 21. for he hearkeneth not
unto him that maketh supplication unto him, and even though
he shall present unto him offerings and funerary gifts of all
kinds, he will not regard them.</p>

<p>"Hail, all ye who arrive in this funeral mountain, present
ye unto me offerings, cast incense into the flame and pour
out libations at every festival of Amentet."</p>

<p>The scribe and sculptor, the councillor, the chief of the
mysteries of the House of Shent in Tenen, the priest of
Horus, Imhetep, the son of the priest Kh&#257;-Hap, whose word

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_134" id="Footnote_1_134"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_134"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> These words mean, "The king gives an offering," and the formula is

<h3>TALES OF TRAVEL AND ADVENTURE<br /><br /></h3>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Story of Sanehat</span></h3>

<p>The text of this very interesting story is found written in
the hieratic character upon papyri which are preserved in
Berlin. The narrative describes events which are said to
have taken place under one of the kings of the twelfth
dynasty, and it is very possible that the foundation of this
story is historical. The hero is himself supposed to relate
his own adventures thus:</p>

<p>The Erp&#257;, the Duke, the Chancellor of the King of the
North, the <i>smer uati</i>, the judge, the &#256;ntchmer of the marches,
the King in the lands of the Nubians, the veritable royal
kinsman loving him, the member of the royal bodyguard,
Sanehat, saith: I am a member of the bodyguard of his
lord, the servant of the King, and of the house of Neferit, the
feudal chieftainess, the Erp&#257;t princess, the highly favoured
lady, the royal wife of Usertsen, whose word is truth in
Khnemetast, the royal daughter of Amenemh&#257;t, whose
word is truth in Qanefer. On the seventh day of the third
month of the season Akhet, in the thirtieth year [of his
reign], the god drew nigh to his horizon, and the King of the
South, the King of the North, Sehetepabr&#257;,<a name="FNanchor_1_143" id="FNanchor_1_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_143" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> ascended into
heaven, and was invited to the Disk, and his divine members
mingled with those of him that made him. The King's
House was in silence, hearts were bowed down in sorrow,
the two Great Gates were shut fast, the officials sat motionless,
and the people mourned.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_143" id="Footnote_1_143"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_143"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <i>i.e.</i> Amenemh&#257;t II.</p></div>

<p>Now behold [before his death] His Majesty had despatched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_156" id="Pg_156" title="Pg_156">[156]</a></span>an army to the Land of the Themehu, under the command
of his eldest son, the beautiful god Usertsen. And he went
and raided the desert lands in the south, and captured slaves
from the Thehenu (Libyans), and he was at that moment
returning and bringing back Libyan slaves and innumerable
beasts of every kind. And the high officers of the Palace
sent messengers into the western country to inform the
King's son concerning what had taken place in the royal
abode. And the messengers found him on the road, and they
came to him by night and asked him if it was not the proper
time for him to hasten his return, and to set out with his
bodyguard without letting his army in general know of his
departure. They also told him that a message had been
sent to the princes who were in command of the soldiers in
his train not to proclaim [the matter of the King's death] to
any one else.</p>

<p>Sanehat continues: When I heard his voice speaking I
rose up and fled. My heart was cleft in twain, my arms
dropped by my side, and trembling seized all my limbs. I
ran about distractedly, hither and thither, seeking a hiding-place.
I went into the thickets in order to find a place
wherein I could travel without being seen. I made my
way upstream, and I decided not to appear in the Palace,
for I did not know but that deeds of violence were taking
place there. And I did not say, "Let life follow it," but I
went on my way to the district of the Sycamore. Then I
came to the Lake (or Island) of Seneferu, and I passed the
whole day there on the edge of the plain. On the following
morning I continued my journey, and a man rose up immediately
in front of me on the road, and he cried for mercy;
he was afraid of me. When the night fell I walked into the
village of Nekau, and I crossed the river in an <i>usekht</i> boat
without a rudder, by the help of the wind from the west.
And I travelled eastwards of the district of Aku, by the pass
of the goddess Herit, the Lady of the Red Mountain. Then
I allowed my feet to take the road downstream, and I travelled
on to Anebuheq, the fortress that had been built to drive
back the Satiu (nomad marauders), and to hold in check
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_157" id="Pg_157" title="Pg_157">[157]</a></span>the tribes that roamed the desert. I crouched down in the
scrub during the day to avoid being seen by the watchmen
on the top of the fortress. I set out again on the march,
when the night fell, and when daylight fell on the earth
I arrived at Peten, and I rested myself by the Lake of Kamur.
Then thirst came upon me and overwhelmed me. I suffered
torture. My throat was burnt up, and I said, "This indeed
is the taste of death." But I took courage, and collected
my members (<i>i.e.</i> myself), for I heard the sounds that are
made by flocks and herds. Then the Satiu of the desert
saw me, and the master of the caravan who had been in
Egypt recognised me. And he rose up and gave me some
water, and he warmed milk [for me], and I travelled with
the men of his caravan, and thus I passed through one country
after the other [in safety]. I avoided the land of Sunu and
I journeyed to the land of Qetem, where I stayed for a year
and a half.</p>

<p>And &#256;mmuiansha, the Sh&#275;kh of Upper Thennu, took me
aside and said unto me, "Thou wilt be happy with me, for
thou wilt hear the language of Egypt." Now he said this
because he knew what manner of man I was, for he had heard
the people of Egypt who were there with him bear testimony
concerning my character. And he said unto me, "Why and
wherefore hast thou come hither? Is it because the departure
of King Sehetepabr&#257; from the Palace to the horizon
hath taken place, and thou didst not know what would be
the result of it?" Then I spake unto him with words of
deceit, saying, "I was among the soldiers who had gone to the
land of Themeh. My heart cried out, my courage failed
me utterly, it made me follow the ways over which I fled.
I hesitated, but felt no regret. I did not hearken unto any
evil counsel, and my name was not heard on the mouth of
the herald. How I came to be brought into this country
I know not; it was, perhaps, by the Providence of God."</p>

<p>And &#256;mmuiansha said unto me, "What will become of
the land without that beneficent god the terror of whom passed
through the lands like the goddess Sekhmet in a year of pestilence?"
Then I made answer unto him, saying, "His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_158" id="Pg_158" title="Pg_158">[158]</a></span>son shall save us. He hath entered the Palace, and hath
taken possession of the heritage of his father. Moreover, he
is the god who hath no equal, and no other can exist beside
him, the lord of wisdom, perfect in his plans, of good will
when he passeth decrees, and one cometh forth and goeth
in according to his ordinance. He reduced foreign lands to
submission whilst his father [sat] in the Palace directing
him in the matters which had to be carried out. He is mighty
of valour, he slayeth with his sword, and in bravery he hath
no compeer. One should see him attacking the nomads of
the desert, and pouncing upon the robbers of the highway!
He beateth down opposition, he smiteth arms helpless, his
enemies cannot be made to resist him. He taketh vengeance,
he cleaveth skulls, none can stand up before him. His
strides are long, he slayeth him that fleeth, and he who turneth
his back upon him in flight never reacheth his goal.
When attacked his courage standeth firm. He attacketh
again and again, and he never yieldeth. His heart is bold
when he seeth the battle array, he permitteth none to sit
down behind. His face is fierce [as] he rusheth on the
attacker. He rejoiceth when he taketh captive the chief
of a band of desert robbers. He seizeth his shield, he raineth
blows upon him, but he hath no need to repeat his attack,
for he slayeth his foe before he can hurl his spear at him.
Before he draweth his bow the nomads have fled, his arms
are like the souls of the Great Goddess. He fighteth, and
if he reacheth his object of attack he spareth not, and he
leaveth no remnant. He is beloved, his pleasantness is
great, he is the conqueror, and his town loveth him more
than herself; she rejoiceth in him more than in her god, and
men throng about him with rejoicings. He was king and
conqueror before his birth, and he hath worn his crowns
since he was born. He hath multiplied births, and he it is
whom God hath made to be the joy of this land, which he
hath ruled, and the boundaries of which he hath enlarged.
He hath conquered the Lands of the South, shall he not
conquer the Lands of the North? He hath been created
to smite the hunters of the desert, and to crush the tribes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_159" id="Pg_159" title="Pg_159">[159]</a></span>that roam the sandy waste...." Then the Sh&#275;kh of Upper
Thennu said unto me, "Assuredly Egypt is a happy country
in that it knoweth his vigour. Verily, as long as thou tarriest
with me I will do good unto thee."</p>

<p>And he set me before his children, and he gave me his
eldest daughter to wife, and he made me to choose for myself
a very fine territory which belonged to him, and which lay
on the border of a neighbouring country, and this beautiful
region was called Aa. In it there are figs, and wine is
more abundant than water. Honey is plentiful, oil existeth
in large quantities, and fruits of every kind are on the trees
thereof. Wheat, barley, herds of cattle, and flocks of sheep
and goats are there in untold numbers. And the Sh&#275;kh
showed me very great favour, and his affection for me was
so great that he made me Sh&#275;kh of one of the best tribes in
his country. Bread-cakes were made for me each day, and
each day wine was brought to me with roasted flesh and wild
fowl, and the wild creatures of the plain that were caught
were laid before me, in addition to the game which my
hunting dogs brought in. Food of all kinds was made for
me, and milk was prepared for me in various ways. I passed
many years in this manner, and my children grew up into
fine strong men, and each one of them ruled his tribe. Every
ambassador on his journey to and from Egypt visited me.
I was kind to people of every class. I gave water to the
thirsty man. I suppressed the highway robber. I directed
the operations of the bowmen of the desert, who marched
long distances to suppress the hostile Sh&#275;khs, and to reduce
their power, for the Sh&#275;kh of Thennu had appointed me
General of his soldiers many years before this. Every
country against which I marched I terrified into submission.
I seized the crops by the wells, I looted the flocks and herds,
I carried away the people and their slaves who ate their
bread, I slew the men there. Through my sword and bow,
and through my well-organised campaigns, I was highly
esteemed in the mind of the Sh&#275;kh, and he loved me, for he
knew my bravery, and he set me before his children when
he saw the bravery of my arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_160" id="Pg_160" title="Pg_160">[160]</a></span>Then a certain mighty man of valour of Thennu came and
reviled me in my tent; he was greatly renowned as a man of
war, and he was unequalled in the whole country, which he
had conquered. He challenged me to combat, being urged
to fight by the men of his tribe, and he believed that he could
conquer me, and he determined to take my flocks and herds
as spoil. And the Sh&#275;kh took counsel with me about the
challenge, and I said, "I am not an acquaintance of his,
and I am by no means a friend of his. Have I ever visited
him in his domain or entered his door, or passed through his
compound? [Never!] He is a man whose heart becometh
full of evil thoughts, whensoever he seeth me, and he wisheth
to carry out his fell design and plunder me. He is like a
wild bull seeking to slay the bull of a herd of tame cattle so
that he may make the cows his own. Or rather he is a mere
braggart who wisheth to seize the property which I have
collected by my prudence, and not an experienced warrior.
Or rather he is a bull that loveth to fight, and that loveth
to make attacks repeatedly, fearing that otherwise some
other animal will prove to be his equal. If, however, his
heart be set upon fighting, let him declare [to me] his intention.
Is God, Who knoweth everything, ignorant of what
he hath decided to do?"</p>

<p>And I passed the night in stringing my bow, I made ready
my arrows of war, I unsheathed my dagger, and I put all my
weapons in order. At daybreak the tribes of the land of
Thennu came, and the people who lived on both sides of it
gathered themselves together, for they were greatly concerned
about the combat, and they came and stood up round about
me where I stood. Every heart burned for my success,
and both men and women uttered cries (or exclamations),
and every heart suffered anxiety on my behalf, saying,
"Can there exist possibly any man who is a mightier fighter
and more doughty as a man of war than he?" Then mine
adversary grasped his shield, and his battle-axe, and his
spears, and after he had hurled his weapons at me, and I
had succeeded in avoiding his short spears, which arrived
harmlessly one after the other, he became filled with fury,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_161" id="Pg_161" title="Pg_161">[161]</a></span>and making up his mind to attack me at close quarters he
threw himself upon me. And I hurled my javelin at him,
which remained fast in his neck, and he uttered a long cry
and fell on his face, and I slew him with his own weapons.
And as I stood upon his back I shouted the cry of victory,
and every &#256;amu man (<i>i.e.</i> Asiatic) applauded me, and I
gave thanks to Menthu;<a name="FNanchor_1_144" id="FNanchor_1_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_144" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and the slaves of my opponent
mourned for their lord. And the Sh&#275;kh &#256;mmuiansha took
me in his arms and embraced me. I carried off his (<i>i.e.</i> the
opponent's) property. I seized his cattle as spoil, and what
he meditated doing to me I did unto him. I took possession
of the contents of his tent, I stripped his compound, I became
rich, I increased my store of goods, and I added greatly
to the number of my cattle.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_144" id="Footnote_1_144"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_144"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The War-god of Thebes.</p></div>

<p>Thus did God prosper the man who made Him his support.
Thus that day was washed (<i>i.e.</i> satisfied) the heart of the man
who was compelled to make his escape from his own into
another country. Thus that day the integrity of the man
who was once obliged to take to flight as a miserable fugitive
was proven in the sight of all the Court. Once I was a wanderer
wandering about hungry, and now I can give bread to
my neighbours. Once I had to flee naked from my country,
and now I am the possessor of splendid raiment, and of
apparel made of the finest byssus. Once I was obliged to
do my own errands and to fetch and carry for myself, and now
I am the master of troops of servants. My house is beautiful,
my estate is spacious, and my name is repeated in the
Great House. O Lord of the gods, who hath ordered my
goings, I will offer propitiatory offerings unto Thee: I beseech
Thee to restore me to Egypt, and O be Thou pleased
most graciously to let me once again look upon the spot
where my mind dwelleth for hours [at a time]! How great
a boon would it be for me to cleanse my body in the land of
my birth! Let, I pray, a period of happiness attend me,
and may God give me peace. May He dispose events in
such a way that the close of the career of the man who hath
suffered misery, whose heart hath seen sorrow, who hath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_162" id="Pg_162" title="Pg_162">[162]</a></span>wandered into a strange land, may be happy. Is He not at
peace with me this day? Surely He shall hearken to him
that is afar off.... Let the King of Egypt be at peace
with me, and may I live upon his offerings. Let me salute
the Mistress of the Land (<i>i.e.</i> the Queen) who is in his palace,
and let me hear the greetings of her children. O would that
my members could become young again! For now old age
is stealing on me. Infirmity overtaketh me. Mine eyes
refuse to see, my hands fall helpless, my knees shake, my
heart standeth still, the funerary mourners approach and they
will bear me away to the City of Eternity, wherein I shall
become a follower of Nebertcher. She will declare to me
the beauties of her children, and they shall traverse it with me.</p>

<p>Behold now, the Majesty of the King of Egypt, Kheperkar&#257;,
whose word is truth, having spoken concerning the various
things that had happened to me, sent a messenger to me
bearing royal gifts, such as he would send to the king of a
foreign land, with the intention of making glad the heart of
thy servant now [speaking], and the princes of his palace
made me to hear their salutations. And here is a copy of
the document, which was brought to thy servant [from the
King] instructing him to return to Egypt.</p>

<p>"The royal command of the Horus, &#256;nkh-mestu, Lord
of Nekhebet and Uatchet, &#256;nkh-mestu, King of the South,
King of the North, Kheperkar&#257;, the son of R&#257;, Amenemh&#257;t,
the everliving, to my follower Sanehat. This royal
order is despatched unto thee to inform thee. Thou hast
travelled about everywhere, in one country after another,
having set out from Qetem and reached Thennu, and thou
hast journeyed from place to place at thine own will and
pleasure. Observe now, what thou hast done [unto others,
making them to obey thee], shall be done unto thee. Make
no excuses, for they shall be set aside; argue not with [my]
officials, for thy arguments shall be refuted. Thy heart
shall not reject the plans which thy mind hath formulated.
Thy Heaven (<i>i.e.</i> the Queen), who is in the Palace, is stable
and flourishing at this present time, her head is crowned with
the sovereignty of the earth, and her children are in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_163" id="Pg_163" title="Pg_163">[163]</a></span>royal chambers of the Palace. Lay aside the honours which
thou hast, and thy life of abundance (or luxury), and journey
to Egypt. Come and look upon thy native land, the land
where thou wast born, smell the earth (<i>i.e.</i> do homage) before
the Great Gate, and associate with the nobles thereof. For
at this time thou art beginning to be an old man, and thou
canst no longer produce sons, and thou hast [ever] in thy
mind the day of [thy] burial, when thou wilt assume the form
of a servant [of Osiris]. The unguents for thine embalmment
on the night [of mummification] have been set apart
for thee, together with thy mummy swathings, which are
the work of the hands of the goddess Tait. Thy funerary
procession, which will march on the day of thy union with
the earth, hath been arranged, and there are prepared for
thee a gilded mummy-case, the head whereof is painted
blue, and a canopy made of <i>mesket</i> wood. Oxen shall draw
thee [to the tomb], the wailing women shall precede thee,
the funerary dances shall be performed, those who mourn
thee shall be at the door of thy tomb, the funerary offerings
dedicated to thee shall be proclaimed, sacrifices shall be
offered for thee with thy oblations, and thy funerary edifice
shall be built in white stone, side by side with those of the
princes and princesses. Thy death must not take place in
a foreign land, the &#256;amu folk shall not escort thee [to thy
grave], thou shalt not be placed in the skin of a ram when
thy burial is effected; but at thy burial there shall be ... and
the smiting of the earth, and when thou departest lamentations
shall be made over thy body."</p>

<p>When this royal letter reached me I was standing among
the people of my tribe, and when it had been read to me I
threw myself face downwards on the ground, and bowed
until my head touched the dust, and I clasped the document
reverently to my breast. Then [I rose up] and walked to
and fro in my abode, rejoicing and saying, "How can these
things possibly be done to thy servant who is now speaking,
whose heart made him to fly into foreign lands [where dwell]
peoples who stammer in their speech? Assuredly it is a good
and gracious thought [of the King] to deliver me from death
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_164" id="Pg_164" title="Pg_164">[164]</a></span>[here], for thy Ka (<i>i.e.</i> double) will make my body to end
[its existence] in my native land."</p>

<p>Here is a copy of the reply that was made by the servant
of the Palace, Sanehat, to the above royal document:</p>

<p>"In peace the most beautiful and greatest! Thy <span class="smcap">Ka</span>
knoweth of the flight which thy servant, who is now speaking,
made when he was in a state of ignorance, O thou beautiful
god, Lord of Egypt, beloved of R&#257;, favoured of Menthu,
the Lord of Thebes. May Amen-R&#257;, lord of the thrones of
the Two Lands, and Sebek, and R&#257;, and Horus, and Hathor,
and Tem and his Company of the Gods, and Neferbaiu, and
Semsuu, and Horus of the East, and Nebt-Amehet, the
goddess who is joined to thy head, and the Tchatchau gods
who preside over the Nile flood, and Menu, and Heru-khenti-semti,
and Urrit, the Lady of Punt, and Nut, and Heru-ur
(Haroeris), and R&#257;, and all the gods of Tamera (Egypt), and
of the Islands of the Great Green Sea (<i>i.e.</i> Mediterranean),
bestow upon thee a full measure of their good gifts, and grant
life and serenity to thy nostrils, and may they grant unto thee
an eternity which hath no limit, and everlastingness which
hath no bounds! May thy fear penetrate and extend into
all countries and mountains, and mayest thou be the possessor
of all the region which the sun encircleth in his course. This
is the prayer which thy servant who now speaketh maketh
on behalf of his lord who hath delivered him from Ament.</p>

<p>"The lord of knowledge who knoweth men, the Majesty
of the Setepsa abode (<i>i.e.</i> the Palace), knoweth well that his
servant who is now speaking was afraid to declare the matter,
and that to repeat it was a great thing. The great god (<i>i.e.</i>
the King), who is the counterpart of R&#257;, hath done wisely
in what he hath done, and thy servant who now speaketh
hath meditated upon it in his mind, and hath made himself
to conform to his plans. Thy Majesty is like unto Horus,
and the victorious might of thine arms hath conquered the
whole world. Let thy Majesty command that Maka [chief
of] the country of Qetma, and Khentiaaush [chief of] Khent-Keshu,
and Menus [chief of] the lands of the Fenkhu, be
brought hither, and these Governors will testify that these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_165" id="Pg_165" title="Pg_165">[165]</a></span>things have come to pass at the desire of thy <span class="smcap">Ka</span> (<i>i.e.</i> double),
and that Thenu doth not speak words of overboldness to thee,
and that she is as [obedient as] thy hunting dogs. Behold,
the flight, which thy servant who is now speaking made,
was made by him as the result of ignorance; it was not
wilful, and I did not decide upon it after careful meditation.
I cannot understand how I could ever have separated myself
from my country. It seemeth to me now to have been the
product of a dream wherein a man who is in the swamps of
the Delta imagineth himself to be in Abu (Elephantine, or
Syene), or of a man who whilst standing in fertile fields
imagineth himself to be in the deserts of the S&#363;d&#257;n. I fear
nothing and no man can make with truth [accusations]
against me. I have never turned my ear to disloyal plottings,
and my name hath never been in the mouth of the
crier [of the names of proscribed folk]; though my members
quaked, and my legs shook, my heart guided me, and the God
who ordained this flight of mine led me on. Behold, I am
not a stiff-necked man (or rebel), nay, I held in honour [the
King], for I knew the land of Egypt and that R&#257; hath made
thy fear to exist everywhere in Egypt, and the awe of thee
to permeate every foreign land. I beseech thee to let me
enter my native land. I beseech thee to let me return to
Egypt. Thou art the apparel of the horizon. The Disk
(<i>i.e.</i> the Sun) shineth at thy wish. One drinketh the water
of the river Nile at thy pleasure. One breatheth the air
of heaven when thou givest the word of command. Thy
servant who now speaketh will transfer the possessions
which he hath gotten in this land to his kinsfolk. And as
for the embassy of thy Majesty which hath been despatched
to the servant who now speaketh, I will do according to thy
Majesty's desire, for I live by the breath which thou givest,
O thou beloved of R&#257;, Horus, and Hathor, and thy holy
nostrils are beloved of Menthu, Lord of Thebes; mayest
thou live for ever!"</p>

<p>And I tarried one day in the country of Aa in order to
transfer my possessions to my children. My eldest son
attended to the affairs of the people of my settlement, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_166" id="Pg_166" title="Pg_166">[166]</a></span>the men and women thereof (<i>i.e.</i> the slaves), and all my possessions
were in his hand, and all my children, and all my
cattle, and all my fruit trees, and all my palm plantations
and groves. Then thy servant who is now speaking set
out on his journey and travelled towards the South. When
I arrived at Heruuatu, the captain of the frontier patrol
sent a messenger to inform the Court of my arrival. His
Majesty sent a courteous overseer of the servants of the
Palace, and following him came large boats laden with gifts
from the King for the soldiers of the desert who had escorted
me and guided me to the town of Heruuatu. I addressed
each man among them by name and every toiler had that
which belonged to him. I continued my journey, the wind
bore me along, food was prepared for me and drink made
ready for me, and the best of apparel (?), until I arrived at
Athettaui.<a name="FNanchor_1_145" id="FNanchor_1_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_145" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> On the morning of the day following my arrival,
five officials came to me, and they bore me to the Great House,
and I bowed low until my forehead touched the ground before
him. And the princes and princesses were standing waiting
for me in the <i>umtet</i> chamber, and they advanced to meet me
and to receive me, and the <i>smeru</i> officials conducted me into
the hall, and led me to the privy chamber of the King, where
I found His Majesty [seated] upon the Great Throne in the
<i>umtet</i> chamber of silver-gold. I arrived there, I raised myself
up after my prostrations, and I knew not that I was in his
presence. Then this god (<i>i.e.</i> the King) spake unto me
harshly, and I became like unto a man who is confounded
in the darkness; my intelligence left me, my limbs quaked,
my heart was no longer in my body, and I knew not whether
I was dead or alive. Then His Majesty said unto one of his
high officials, "Raise him, and let him speak unto me." And
His Majesty said unto me, "Thou hast come then! Thou
hast smitten foreign lands and thou hast travelled, but now
weakness hath vanquished thee, thou hast become old, and
the infirmities of thy body are many. The warriors of the
desert shall not escort thee [to thy grave] ... wilt thou not
speak and declare thy name?" And I was afraid to contradict
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_167" id="Pg_167" title="Pg_167">[167]</a></span>him, and I answered him about these matters like a
man who was stricken with fear. Thus did my Lord speak
to me.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_145" id="Footnote_1_145"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_145"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> A fortified town a little to the south of Memphis.</p></div>

<p>And I answered and said, "The matter was not of my
doing, for, behold, it was done by the hand of God; bodily
terror made me to flee according to what was ordained. But,
behold, I am here in thy presence! Thou art life. Thy
Majesty doeth as thou pleasest." And the King dismissed
the royal children, and His Majesty said unto the Queen,
"Look now, this is Sanehat who cometh in the guise of an
Asiatic, and who hath turned himself into a nomad warrior
of the desert." And the Queen laughed a loud hearty laugh,
and the royal children cried out with one voice before His
Majesty, saying, "O Lord King, this man cannot really be
Sanehat"; and His Majesty said, "It is indeed!"</p>

<p>Then the royal children brought their instruments of
music, their <i>menats</i> and their sistra, and they rattled their
sistra, and they passed backwards and forwards before His
Majesty, saying, "Thy hands perform beneficent acts, O
King. The graces of the Lady of Heaven rest [upon thee].
The goddess Nubt giveth life to thy nostrils, and the Lady
of the Stars joineth herself to thee, as thou sailest to the South
wearing the Crown of the North, and to the North wearing
the Crown of the South. Wisdom is stablished in the mouth
of Thy Majesty, and health is on thy brow. Thou strikest
terror into the miserable wretches who entreat thy mercy.
Men propitiate thee, O Lord of Egypt, [as they do] R&#257;, and
thou art acclaimed with cries of joy like Nebertcher. Thy
horn conquereth, thine arrow slayeth, [but] thou givest
breath to him that is afflicted. For our sakes graciously
give a boon to this traveller Sanehat, this desert warrior who
was born in Tamera (Egypt). He fled through fear of thee,
and he departed to a far country because of his terror of thee.
Doth not the face that gazeth on thine blench? Doth not
the eye that gazeth into thine feel terrified?" Then His
Majesty said, "Let him fear not, and let him not utter a
sound of fear. He shall be a <i>smer</i> official among the princes
of the palace, he shall be a member of the company of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_168" id="Pg_168" title="Pg_168">[168]</a></span><i>shenit</i> officials. Get ye gone to the refectory of the palace,
and see to it that rations are provided for him."</p>

<p>Thereupon I came forth from the privy chamber of the
King, and the royal children clasped my hands, and we passed
on to the Great Door, and I was lodged in the house of one
of the King's sons, which was beautifully furnished. In
it there was a bath, and it contained representations of the
heavens and objects from the Treasury. And there [I
found] apparel made of royal linen, and myrrh of the finest
quality which was used by the King, and every chamber was
in charge of officials who were favourites of the King, and
every officer had his own appointed duties. And [there]
the years were made to slide off my members. I cut and
combed my hair, I cast from me the dirt of a foreign land,
together with the apparel of the nomads who live in the desert.
I arrayed myself in apparel made of fine linen, I anointed
my body with costly ointments, I slept upon a bedstead
[instead of on the ground], I left the sand to those who dwelt
on it, and the crude oil of wood wherewith they anoint themselves.
I was allotted the house of a nobleman who had the
title of <i>smer</i>, and many workmen laboured upon it, and its
garden and its groves of trees were replanted with plants
and trees. Rations were brought to me from the palace
three or four times each day, in additions to the gifts which
the royal children gave me unceasingly. And the site of
a stone pyramid among the pyramids was marked out for
me. The surveyor-in-chief to His Majesty chose the site
for it, the director of the funerary designers drafted the
designs and inscriptions which were to be cut upon it, the
chief of the masons of the necropolis cut the inscriptions,
and the clerk of the works in the necropolis went about the
country collecting the necessary funerary furniture. I made
the building to flourish, and provided everything that was
necessary for its upkeep. I acquired land round about it.
I made a lake for the performance of funerary ceremonies,
and the land about it contained gardens, and groves of trees,
and I provided a place where the people on the estate might
dwell similar to that which is provided for a <i>smeru</i> nobleman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_169" id="Pg_169" title="Pg_169">[169]</a></span>of the first rank. My statue, which was made for me by His
Majesty, was plated with gold, and the tunic thereof was of
silver-gold. Not for any ordinary person did he do such
things. May I enjoy the favour of the King until the day
of my death shall come!</p>

<p>Here endeth the book; [given] from its beginning to its
end, as it hath been found in writing.<br /><br /></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Story of the Educated Peasant Khuenanpu</span></h3>

<p>The text of this most interesting story is written in the
hieratic character on papyri which are preserved in the
British Museum and in the Royal Library at Berlin. It is
generally thought that the story is the product of the period
that immediately followed the twelfth dynasty.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there lived a man whose name was
Khuenanpu, a peasant of Sekhet-hemat,<a name="FNanchor_1_146" id="FNanchor_1_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_146" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and he had a wife
whose name was Nefert. This peasant said to this wife of
his, "Behold, I am going down into Egypt in order to bring
back food for my children. Go thou and measure up the
grain which remaineth in the granary, [and see how many]
measures [there are]." Then she measured it, and there were
eight measures. Then this peasant said unto this wife of his,
"Behold, two measures of grain shall be for the support of
thyself and thy children, but of the other six thou shalt make
bread and beer whereon I am to live during the days on which
I shall be travelling." And this peasant went down into
Egypt, having laden his asses with <i>aaa</i> plants, and <i>retmet</i>
plants, and soda and salt, and wood of the district of ...,
and <i>aunt</i> wood of the Land of Oxen,<a name="FNanchor_2_147" id="FNanchor_2_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_147" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and skins of panthers
and wolves, and <i>neshau</i> plants, and <i>anu</i> stones, and <i>tenem</i>
plants, and <i>kheperur</i> plants, and <i>sahut</i>, and <i>saksut</i> seeds (?),
and <i>masut</i> plants, and <i>sent</i> and <i>abu</i> stones, and <i>absa</i> and
<i>anba</i> plants, and doves and <i>naru</i> and <i>ukes</i> birds, and <i>tebu,
uben</i> and <i>tebsu</i> plants, and <i>kenkent</i> seeds, and the plant "hair
of the earth," and <i>anset</i> seeds, and all kinds of beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_170" id="Pg_170" title="Pg_170">[170]</a></span>products of the land of Sekhet-hemat. And when this peasant
had marched to the south, to Hensu,<a name="FNanchor_3_148" id="FNanchor_3_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_148" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and had arrived
at the region of Perfefa, to the north of Metnat, he found a
man standing on the river bank whose name was Tehutinekht,
who was the son of a man whose name was Asri;
both father and son were serfs of Rensi, the son of Meru the
steward. When this man Tehutinekht saw the asses of this
peasant, of which his heart approved greatly, he said, "Would
that I had any kind of god with me to help me to seize for
myself the goods of this peasant!" Now the house of this
Tehutinekht stood upon the upper edge of a sloping path
along the river bank, which was narrow and not wide. It
was about as wide as a sheet of linen cloth, and upon one
side of it was the water of the stream, and on the other was
a growing crop. Then this Tehutinekht said unto his slave,
"Run and bring me a sheet of linen out of my house"; and
it was brought to him immediately. Then he shook out the
sheet of linen over the narrow sloping path in such a way
that its upper edge touched the water, and the fringed edge
the growing crop. And when this peasant was going along
the public path, this Tehutinekht said unto him, "Be careful,
peasant, wouldst thou walk upon my clothes?" And
this peasant said, "I will do as thou pleasest; my way is
good." And when he turned to the upper part of the path,
this Tehutinekht said, "Is my corn to serve as a road for thee,
O peasant?" Then this peasant said, "My way is good.
The river-bank is steep, and the road is covered up with thy
corn, and thou hast blocked up the path with thy linen
garment. Dost thou really intend not to let us pass? Hath
it come to pass that he dareth to say such a thing?" [At
that moment] one of the asses bit off a large mouthful of the
growing corn, and this Tehutinekht said, "Behold, thy ass
is eating my corn! Behold, he shall come and tread it out."
Then this peasant said, "My way is good. Because one
side of the road was made impassable [by thee], I led my ass
to the other side (?), and now thou hast seized my ass because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_171" id="Pg_171" title="Pg_171">[171]</a></span>he bit off a large mouthful of the growing corn. However,
I know the master of this estate, which belongeth to Rensi,
the son of Meru. There is no doubt that he hath driven
every robber out of the whole country, and shall I be robbed
on his estate?" And this Tehutinekht said, "Is not this
an illustration of the proverb which the people use, 'The
name of the poor man is only mentioned because of his
master?' It is I who speak to thee, but it is the steward
[Rensi, the son of Meru] of whom thou art thinking." Then
Tehutinekht seized a cudgel of green tamarisk wood, and
beat cruelly with it every part of the peasant's body, and
took his asses from him and carried them off into his compound.
And this peasant wept and uttered loud shrieks of
pain because of what was done to him. And this Tehutinekht
said, "Howl not so loudly, peasant, or verily [thou
shalt depart] to the domain of the Lord of Silence."<a name="FNanchor_4_149" id="FNanchor_4_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_149" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Then
this peasant said, "Thou hast beaten me, and robbed me of
my possessions, and now thou wishest to steal even the very
complaint that cometh out of my mouth! Lord of Silence
indeed! Give me back my goods. Do not make me to utter
complaints about thy fearsome character."</p>

<p>And this peasant spent ten whole days in making entreaties
to this Tehutinekht [for the restoration of his goods], but
Tehutinekht paid no attention to them whatsoever. At
the end of this time this peasant set out on a journey to the
south, to the city of Hensu, in order to lay his complaint
before Rensi, the son of Meru, the steward, and he found him
just as he was coming forth from the door in the courtyard
of his house which opened on the river bank, to embark in
his official boat on the river. And this peasant said, "I
earnestly wish that it may happen that I may make glad thy
heart with the words which I am going to say! Peradventure
thou wilt allow some one to call thy confidential servant to
me, in order that I may send him back to thee thoroughly
well informed as to my business." Then Rensi, the son of
Meru, the steward, caused his confidential servant to go to
this peasant, who sent him back to him thoroughly well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_172" id="Pg_172" title="Pg_172">[172]</a></span>informed as to his business. And Rensi, the son of Meru,
the steward, made inquiries about this Tehutinekht from
the officials who were immediately connected with him, and
they said unto him, "Lord, the matter is indeed only one
that concerneth one of the peasants of Tehutinekht who
went [to do business] with another man near him instead of
with him. And, as a matter of fact, [officials like Tehutinekht]
always treat their peasants in this manner whensoever
they go to do business with other people instead of with
them. Wouldst thou trouble thyself to inflict punishment
upon Tehutinekht for the sake of a little soda and a little
salt? [It is unthinkable.] Just let Tehutinekht be ordered
to restore the soda and the salt and he will do so [immediately]."
And Rensi, the son of Meru, the steward, held his
peace; he made no answer to the words of these officials,
and to this peasant he made no reply whatsoever.</p>

<p>And this peasant came to make his complaint to Rensi,
the son of Meru, the steward, and on the first occasion he
said, "O my lord steward, greatest one of the great ones,
guide of the things that are not and of these that are, when
thou goest down into the Sea of Truth,<a name="FNanchor_5_150" id="FNanchor_5_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_150" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and dost sail thereon,
may the attachment (?) of thy sail not tear away, may thy
boat not drift (?), may no accident befall thy mast, may the
poles of thy boat not be broken, mayest thou not run aground
when thou wouldst walk on the land, may the current not
carry thee away, mayest thou not taste the calamities of the
stream, mayest thou never see a face of fear, may the timid
fish come to thee, and mayest thou obtain fine, fat waterfowl.
O thou who art the father of the orphan, the husband of the
widow, the brother of the woman who hath been put away
by her husband, and the clother of the motherless, grant that
I may place thy name in this land in connection with all good
law. Guide in whom there is no avarice, great man in whom
there is no meanness, who destroyest falsehood and makest
what is true to exist, who comest to the word of my mouth,
I speak that thou mayest hear. Perform justice, O thou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_173" id="Pg_173" title="Pg_173">[173]</a></span>who art praised, to whom those who are most worthy of
praise give praise. Do away the oppression that weigheth
me down. Behold, I am weighted with sorrow, behold, I
am sorely wronged. Try me, for behold, I suffer greatly."</p>

<p>Now this peasant spake these words in the time of the King
of the South, the King of the North, Nebkaur&#257;, whose word
is truth. And Rensi, the son of Meru, the steward, went
into the presence of His Majesty, and said, "My Lord, I
have found one of these peasants who can really speak with
true eloquence. His goods have been stolen from him by
an official who is in my service, and behold, he hath come to
lay before me a complaint concerning this." His Majesty
said unto Rensi, the son of Meru, the steward, "If thou
wouldst see me in a good state of health, keep him here, and
do not make any answer at all to anything which he shall
say, so that he may continue to speak. Then let that which
he shall say be done into writing, and brought unto us, so that
we may hear it. Take care that his wife and his children have
food to live upon, and see that one of these peasants goeth to
remove want from his house. Provide food for the peasant
himself to live upon, but thou shalt make the provision in
such a way that the food may be given to him without letting
him know that it is thou who hast given it to him. Let the
food be given to his friends and let them give it to him." So
there were given unto him four bread-cakes and two pots of
beer daily. These were provided by Rensi, the son of Meru,
the steward, and he gave them to a friend, and it was this
friend who gave them to the peasant. And Rensi, the son
of Meru, the steward, sent instructions to the governor of
[the Oasis of] Sekhet-hemat to supply the wife of the peasant
with daily rations, and there were given unto her regularly
the bread-cakes that were made from three measures of corn.</p>

<p>Then this peasant came a second time to lay his complaint
[before Rensi], and he found him as he was coming out from
the ..., and he said, "O steward, my lord, the greatest of
the great, thou richest of the rich, whose greatness is true
greatness, whose riches are true riches, thou rudder of heaven,
thou pole of the earth, thou measuring rope for heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_174" id="Pg_174" title="Pg_174">[174]</a></span>weights (?)! O rudder, slip not, O pole, topple not, O
measuring rope, make no mistake in measuring! The great
lord taketh away from her that hath no master (or owner), and
stealeth from him that is alone [in the world]. Thy rations
are in thy house&mdash;a pot of beer and three bread-cakes. What
dost thou spend in satisfying those who depend upon thee?
Shall he who must die die with his people? Wilt thou be a
man of eternity (<i>i.e.</i> wilt thou live for ever?) Behold, are
not these things evils, namely, the balance that leaneth side-ways,
the pointer of the balance that doth not show the
correct weight, and an upright and just man who departeth
from his path of integrity? Observe! the truth goeth
badly with thee, being driven out of her proper place, and the
officials commit acts of injustice. He who ought to estimate
a case correctly giveth a wrong decision. He who ought to
keep himself from stealing committeth an act of robbery.
He who should be strenuous to arrest the man who breaketh
the word (<i>i.e.</i> Law) in its smallest point, is himself guilty of
departing therefrom. He who should give breath stifleth
him that could breathe. The land that ought to give repose
driveth repose away. He who should divide in fairness hath
become a robber. He who should blot out the oppressor
giveth him the command to turn the town into a waste of
water. He who should drive away evil himself committeth
acts of injustice."</p>

<p>Then Rensi, the son of Meru, the steward, said [to the
peasant], "Doth thy case appear in thy heart so serious
that I must have my servant [Tchutinekht] seized on thy
account?" This peasant said, "He who measureth the
heaps of corn filcheth from them for himself, and he who
filleth [the measure] for others robbeth his neighbours. Since
he who should carry out the behests of the Law giveth the
order to rob, who is to repress crime? He who should do
away with offences against the Law himself committeth
them. He who should act with integrity behaveth crookedly.
He who doeth acts of injustice is applauded. When
wilt thou find thyself able to resist and to put down acts
of injustice? [When] the ... cometh to his place of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_175" id="Pg_175" title="Pg_175">[175]</a></span>yesterday the command cometh: 'Do a [good] deed in order
that one may do a [good] deed [to thee],' that is to say,
'Give thanks unto everyone for what he doeth.' This is
to drive back the bolt before it is shot, and to give a command
to the man who is already overburdened with orders. Would
that a moment of destruction might come, wherein thy vines
should be laid low, and thy geese diminished, and thy waterfowl
be made few in number! [Thus] it cometh that the
man who ought to see clearly hath become blind, and he who
ought to hear distinctly hath become deaf, and he who ought
to be a just guide hath become one who leadeth into error.
Observe! thou art strong and powerful. Thine arm is able
to do deeds of might, and [yet] thy heart is avaricious. Compassion
hath removed itself from thee. The wretched man
whom thou hast destroyed crieth aloud in his anguish. Thou
art like unto the messenger of the god Henti (the Crocodile-god).
Set not out [to do evil] for the Lady of the Plague
(<i>i.e.</i> Sekhmet).... As there is nothing between thee and
her for a certain purpose, so there is nothing against thee
and her. If thou wilt not do it [then] she will not show compassion.
The beggar hath the powerful owner of possessions
(or revenues) robbed, and the man who hath nothing hath the
man who hath secreted [much] stolen goods. To steal anything
at all from the beggar is an absolute crime on the part of the
man who is not in want, and [if he doth this] shall his action
not be inquired into? Thou art filled full with thy bread,
and art drunken with thy beer, and thou art rich [beyond
count]. When the face of the steersman is directed to what
is in front of him, the boat falleth out of its course, and saileth
whithersoever it pleaseth. When the King [remaineth] in
his house, and when thou workest the rudder, acts of injustice
take place round about thee, complaints are widespread,
and the loss (?) is very serious. And one saith, 'What is
taking place?' Thou shouldst make thyself a place of refuge
[for the needy]. Thy quay should be safe. But observe!
Thy town is in commotion. Thy tongue is righteous, make
no mistake [in judgment]. The abominable behaviour of
a man is, as it were, [one of] his members. Speak no lies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_176" id="Pg_176" title="Pg_176">[176]</a></span>thyself, and take good heed that thy high officials do not
do so. Those who assess the dues on the crops are like unto
a ..., and to tell lies is very dear to their hearts. Thou
who hast knowledge of the affairs of all the people, dost thou
not understand my circumstances? Observe, thou who relievest
the wants of all who have suffered by water, I am
on the path of him that hath no boat. O thou who bringest
every drowning man to land, and who savest the man whose
boat hath foundered, art thou going to let me perish?"</p>

<p>And this peasant came a third time to lay his complaint
[before Rensi], and he said, "O my Lord Rensi, the steward!
Thou art R&#257;, the lord of heaven with thy great chiefs. The
affairs of all men [are ruled by thee]. Thou art like the
water-flood. Thou art Hep (the Nile-god) who maketh
green the fields, and who maketh the islands that are deserts
to become productive. Exterminate the robber, be thou
the advocate of those who are in misery, and be not towards
the petitioner like the water-flood that sweepeth him away.
Take heed to thyself likewise, for eternity cometh, and behave
in such a way that the proverb, 'Righteousness (or
truth) is the breath of the nostrils,' may be applicable unto
thee. Punish those who are deserving of punishment, and
then these shall be like unto thee in dispensing justice. Do
not the small scales weigh incorrectly? Doth not the large
balance incline to one side? In such cases is not Thoth
merciful? When thou doest acts of injustice thou becomest
the second of these three, and if these be merciful thou also
mayest be merciful. Answer not good with evil, and do not
set one thing in the place of another. Speech flourisheth
more than the <i>senmit</i> plants, and groweth stronger than the
smell of the same. Make no answer to it whilst thou pourest
out acts of injustice, to make to grow apparel, which three
... will cause him to make. [If] thou workest the steering
pole against the sail (?), the flood shall gather strength
against the doing of what is right. Take good heed to thyself
and set thyself on the mat (?) on the look-out place.
The equilibrium of the earth is maintained by the doing of
what is right. Tell not lies, for thou art a great man. Act
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_177" id="Pg_177" title="Pg_177">[177]</a></span>not in a light manner, for thou art a man of solid worth.
Tell not lies, for thou art a pair of scales. Make no mistake
[in thy weighing], for thou art a correct reckoner (?). Observe!
Thou art all of a piece with the pair of scales. If
they weigh incorrectly, thou also shalt act falsely. Let not
the boat run aground when thou art working the steering
pole ... the look-out place. When thou hast to proceed
against one who hath carried off something, take thou
nothing, for behold, the great man ceaseth to be a great man
when he is avaricious. Thy tongue is the pointer of the
scales; thy heart is the weight; thy lips are the two arms
of the scales. If thou coverest thy face so as not to see the
doer of violent deeds, who is there [left] to repress lawless
deeds? Observe! Thou art like a poor man for the man
who washeth clothes, who is avaricious and destroyeth kindly
feeling (?). He who forsaketh the friend who endoweth him
for the sake of his client is his brother, who hath come and
brought him a gift. Observe! Thou art a ferryman who
ferriest over the stream only the man who possesseth the
proper fare, whose integrity is well attested (?). Observe!
Thou art like the overseer of a granary who doth not at once
permit to pass him that cometh empty. Observe! Thou
art among men like a bird of prey that liveth upon weak
little birds. Observe! Thou art like the cook whose sole
joy is to kill, whom no creature escapeth. Observe! Thou
art like a shepherd who is careless about the loss of his sheep
through the rapacious crocodile; thou never countest [thy
sheep]. Would that thou wouldst make evil and rapacious
men to be fewer! Safety hath departed from [every] town
throughout the land. Thou shouldst hear, but most assuredly
thou hearest not! Why hast thou not heard that I
have this day driven back the rapacious man? When the
crocodile pursueth.... How long is this condition of thine
to last? Truth which is concealed shall be found, and falsehood
shall perish. Do not imagine that thou art master of
to-morrow, which hath not yet come, for the evils which it
may bring with it are unknown."</p>

<p>And behold, when this peasant had said these things to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_178" id="Pg_178" title="Pg_178">[178]</a></span>Rensi, the son of Meru, the steward, at the entrance to the
hall of the palace, Rensi caused two men with leather whips
to seize him, and they beat him in every member of his body.
Then this peasant said: "The son of Meru hath made a
mistake. His face is blind in respect of what he seeth, he is
deaf in respect of what he heareth, and he is forgetting that
which he ought to remember. Observe! Thou art like unto
a town that hath no governor, and a community that hath
no chief, and a ship that hath no captain, and a body of men
who have no guide. Observe! Thou art like a high official
who is a thief, a governor of a town who taketh [bribes], and
the overseer of a province who hath been appointed to suppress
robbery, but who hath become the captain of those
who practise it."</p>

<p>And this peasant came a fourth time to lay his complaint
before Rensi, and he met him as he was coming out from
the door of the temple of the god Herushefit, and said, "O
thou who art praised, the god Herushefit, from whose house
thou comest forth, praiseth thee. When well-doing perisheth,
and there is none who seeketh to prevent its destruction,
falsehood maketh itself seen boldly in the land. If it happen
that the ferry-boat is not brought for thee to cross the stream
in, how wilt thou be able to cross the stream? If thou hast
to cross the stream in thy sandals, is thy crossing pleasant?
Assuredly it is not! What man is there who continueth to
sleep until it is broad daylight? [This habit] destroyeth
the marching by night, and the travelling by day, and the
possibility of a man profiting by his good luck, in very truth.
Observe! One cannot tell thee sufficiently often that 'Compassion
hath departed from thee.' And behold, how the
oppressed man whom thou hast destroyed complaineth!
Observe! Thou art like unto a man of the chase who would
satisfy his craving for bold deeds, who determineth to do
what he wisheth, to spear the hippopotamus, to shoot the
wild bull, to catch fish, and to catch birds in his nets. He
who is without hastiness will not speak without due thought.
He whose habit is to ponder deeply will not be light-minded.
Apply thy heart earnestly and thou shalt know the truth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_179" id="Pg_179" title="Pg_179">[179]</a></span>Pursue diligently the course which thou hast chosen, and
let him that heareth the plaintiff act rightly. He who followeth
a right course of action will not treat a plaintiff
wrongly. When the arm is brought, and when the two eyes
see, and when the heart is of good courage, boast not loudly
in proportion to thy strength, in order that calamity may
not come unto thee. He who passeth by [his] fate halteth
between two opinions. The man who eateth tasteth [his
food], the man who is spoken to answereth, the man who
sleepeth seeth visions, but nothing can resist the presiding
judge when he is the pilot of the doer [of evil]. Observe,
O stupid man, thou art apprehended. Observe, O ignorant
man, thou art freely discussed. Observe, too, that men
intrude upon thy most private moments. Steersman, let
not thy boat run aground. Nourisher [of men], let not
men die. Destroyer [of men], let not men perish. Shadow,
let not men perish through the burning heat. Place of
refuge, let not the crocodile commit ravages. It is now four
times that I have laid my complaint before thee. How much
more time shall I spend in doing this?"</p>

<p>This peasant came a fifth time to make his complaint,
and said, "O my lord steward, the fisherman with a <i>khut</i>
instrument ..., the fisherman with a ... killeth <i>i</i>-fish,
the fisherman with a harpoon speareth the <i>&#257;ubbu</i> fish, the
fisherman with a <i>tchabhu</i> instrument catcheth the <i>paqru</i>
fish, and the common fishermen are always drawing fish from
the river. Observe! Thou art even as they. Wrest not
the goods of the poor man from him. The helpless man
thou knowest him. The goods of the poor man are the
breath of his life; to seize them and carry them off from him
is to block up his nostrils. Thou art committed to the hearing
of a case and to the judging between two parties at law,
so that thou mayest suppress the robber; but, verily, what
thou doest is to support the thief. The people love thee,
and yet thou art a law-breaker. Thou hast been set as a
dam before the man of misery, take heed that he is not
drowned. Verily, thou art like a lake to him, O thou who
flowest quickly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_180" id="Pg_180" title="Pg_180">[180]</a></span>This peasant came the sixth time to lay his complaint
[before Rensi], and said, "O my lord steward ... who
makest truth to be, who makest happiness (or, what is good)
to be, who destroyest [all evil]; thou art like unto the
satiety that cometh to put an end to hunger, thou art like
unto the raiment that cometh to do away nakedness; thou
art like unto the heavens that become calm after a violent
storm and refresh with warmth those who are cold; thou
art like unto the fire that cooketh that which is raw, and thou
art like unto the water that quencheth the thirst. Yet look
round about thee! He who ought to make a division fairly
is a robber. He who ought to make everyone to be satisfied
hath been the cause of the trouble. He who ought to be
the source of healing is one of those who cause sicknesses.
The transgressor diminisheth the truth. He who filleth
well the right measure acteth rightly, provided that he giveth
neither too little nor too much. If an offering be brought
unto thee, do thou share it with thy brother (or neighbour),
for that which is given in charity is free from after-thought (?).
The man who is dissatisfied induceth separation, and the
man who hath been condemned bringeth on schisms, even
before one can know what is in his mind. When thou hast
arrived at a decision delay not in declaring it. Who keepeth
within him that which he can eject?... When a boat
cometh into port it is unloaded, and the freight thereof is
landed everywhere on the quay. It is [well] known that
thou hast been educated, and trained, and experienced,
but behold, it is not that thou mayest rob [the people].
Nevertheless thou dost [rob them] just as other people do,
and those who are found about thee are thieves (?). Thou
who shouldst be the most upright man of all the people art
the greatest transgressor in the whole country. [Thou art]
the wicked gardener who watereth his plot of ground with
evil deeds in order to make his plot to tell lies, so that he may
flood the town (or estate) with evil deeds (or calamities)."</p>

<p>This peasant came the seventh time in order to lay his
complaint [before Rensi], and said, "O my lord steward,
thou art the steering pole of the whole land, and the land
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_181" id="Pg_181" title="Pg_181">[181]</a></span>saileth according to thy command. Thou art the second
(or counterpart) of Thoth, who judgeth impartially. My
lord, permit thou a man to appeal to thee in respect of his
cause which is righteous. Let not thy heart fight against
it, for it is unseemly for thee to do so; [if thou doest this]
thou of the broad face wilt become evil-hearted. Curse
not the thing that hath not yet taken place, and rejoice not
over that which hath not yet come to pass. The tolerant
judge rejoiceth in showing kindness, and he withholdeth all
action concerning a decision that hath been given, when he
knoweth not what plan was in the heart. In the case of the
judge who breaketh the Law, and overthroweth uprightness,
the poor man cannot live [before him], for the judge plundereth
him, and the truth saluteth him not. But my body
is full, and my heart is overloaded, and the expression thereof
cometh forth from my body by reason of the condition of
the same. [When] there is a breach in the dam the water
poureth out through it: even so is my mouth opened and it
uttereth speech. I have now emptied myself, I have poured
out what I had to pour out, I have unburdened my body,
I have finished washing my linen. What I had to say before
thee is said, my misery hath been fully set out before thee;
now what hast thou to say in excuse (or apology)? Thy
lazy cowardice hath been the cause of thy sin, thine avarice
hath rendered thee stupid, and thy gluttony hath been thine
enemy. Thinkest thou that thou wilt never find another
peasant like unto me? If he hath a complaint to make
thinkest thou that he will not stand, if he is a lazy man,
at the door of his house? He whom thou forcest to speak
will not remain silent. He whom thou forcest to wake up
will not remain asleep. The faces which thou makest keen
will not remain stupid. The mouth which thou openest will
not remain closed. He whom thou makest intelligent will
not remain ignorant. He whom thou instructest will not
remain a fool. These are they who destroy evils. These are
the officials, the lords of what is good. These are the crafts-folk
who make what existeth. These are they who put on
their bodies again the heads that have been cut off."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_182" id="Pg_182" title="Pg_182">[182]</a></span>This peasant came the eighth time to lay his complaint
[before Rensi], and said, "O my lord steward, a man falleth
because of covetousness. The avaricious man hath no aim,
for his aim is frustrated. Thy heart is avaricious, which
befitteth thee not. Thou plunderest, and thy plunder is
no use to thee. And yet formerly thou didst permit a man
to enjoy that to which he had good right! Thy daily bread
is in thy house, thy belly is filled, grain overfloweth [in thy
granaries], and the overflow perisheth and is wasted. The
officials who have been appointed to suppress acts of injustice
have been rapacious robbers, and the officials who have been
appointed to stamp out falsehood have become hiding-places
for those who work iniquity. It is not fear of thee that hath
driven me to make my complaint to thee, for thou dost not
understand my mind (or heart). The man who is silent and
who turneth back in order to bring his miserable state [before
thee] is not afraid to place it before thee, and his brother
doth not bring [gifts] from the interior of [his quarter]. Thy
estates are in the fields, thy food is on [thy] territory,
and thy bread is in the storehouse, yet the officials make
gifts to thee and thou seizest them. Art thou not then a
robber? Will not the men who plunder hasten with thee
to the divisions of the fields? Perform the truth for the
Lord of Truth, who possesseth the real truth. Thou writing
reed, thou roll of papyrus, thou palette, thou Thoth, thou
art remote from acts of justice. O Good One, thou art
still goodness. O Good One, thou art truly good. Truth
endureth for ever. It goeth down to the grave with those
who perform truth, it is laid in the coffin and is buried in
the earth; its name is never removed from the earth, and
its name is remembered on earth for good (or blessing). That
is the ordinance of the word of God. If it be a matter of a
hand-balance it never goeth askew; if it be a matter of a
large pair of scales, the standard thereof never inclineth to
one side. Whether it be I who come, or another, verily
thou must make speech, but do not answer whether thou
speakest to one who ought to hold his peace, or whether thou
seizest one who cannot seize thee. Thou art not merciful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_183" id="Pg_183" title="Pg_183">[183]</a></span>thou art not considerate. Thou hast not withdrawn thyself,
thou hast not gone afar off. But thou hast not in any way
given in respect of me any judgment in accordance with
the command, which came forth from the mouth of R&#257;
himself, saying, 'Speak the truth, perform the truth, for
truth is great, mighty, and everlasting. When thou performest
the truth thou wilt find its virtues (?), and it will
lead thee to the state of being blessed (?). If the hand-balance
is askew, the pans of the balance, which perform the
weighing, hang crookedly, and a correct weighing cannot be
carried out, and the result is a false one; even so the result
of wickedness is wickedness.'"</p>

<p>This peasant came the ninth time to lay his complaint
[before Rensi], and said, "The great balance of men is their
tongues, and all the rest is put to the test by the hand balance.
When thou punishest the man who ought to be punished,
the act telleth in thy favour. [When he doeth not this]
falsehood becometh his possession, truth turneth away from
before him, his goods are falsehood, truth forsaketh him,
and supporteth him not. If falsehood advanceth, she
maketh a mistake, and goeth not over with the ferry-boat
[to the Island of Osiris]. The man with whom falsehood
prevaileth hath no children and no heirs upon the earth.
The man in whose boat falsehood saileth never reacheth land,
and his boat never cometh into port. Be not heavy, but at
the same time do not be too light. Be not slow, but at the
same time be not too quick. Rage not at the man who is
listening to thee. Cover not over thy face before the man
with whom thou art acquainted. Make not blind thy face
towards the man who is looking at thee. Thrust not aside
the suppliant as thou goest down. Be not indolent in making
known thy decision. Do [good] unto him that will do
[good] unto thee. Hearken not unto the cry of the mob,
who say, 'A man will assuredly cry out when his case is
really righteous.' There is no yesterday for the indolent
man, there is no friend for the man who is deaf to [the words
of] truth, and there is no day of rejoicing for the avaricious
man. The informer becometh a poor man, and the poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_184" id="Pg_184" title="Pg_184">[184]</a></span>man becometh a beggar, and the unfriendly man becometh a
dead person. Observe now, I have laid my complaint before
thee, but thou wilt not hearken unto it; I shall now depart,
and make my complaint against thee to Anubis."</p>

<p>Then Rensi, the son of Meru, the steward, caused two of
his servants to go and bring back the peasant. Now this
peasant was afraid, for he believed that he would be beaten
severely because of the words which he had spoken to him.
And this peasant said, "This is [like] the coming of the
thirsty man to salt tears, and the taking of the mouth of the
suckling child to the breast of the woman that is dry. That
the sight of which is longed for cometh not, and only death
approacheth."</p>

<p>Then Rensi, the son of Meru, the steward, said, "Be not
afraid, O peasant, for behold, thou shalt dwell with me."
Then this peasant swore an oath, saying, "Assuredly I will
eat of thy bread, and drink of thy beer for ever." Then
Rensi, the son of Meru, the steward, said, "Come hither,
however, so that thou mayest hear thy petitions"; and he
caused to be [written] on a roll of new papyrus all the complaints
which this peasant had made, each complaint according
to its day. And Rensi, the son of Meru, the steward,
sent the papyrus to the King of the South, the King of the
North, Nebkaur&#257;, whose word is truth, and it pleased the
heart of His Majesty more than anything else in the whole
land. And His Majesty said, "Pass judgment on thyself,
O son of Meru." And Rensi, the son of Meru, the steward,
despatched two men to bring him back. And he was brought
back, and an embassy was despatched to Sekhet Hemat....
Six persons, besides ... his grain, and his millet, and his
asses, and his dogs.... [The remaining lines are mutilated,
but the words which are visible make it certain that
Tehutinekht the thief was punished, and that he was made
to restore to the peasant everything which he had stolen
from him.]<br /><br /></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Journey of the Priest Unu-Amen into Syria to
buy Cedar Wood to make a new Boat for Amen-R&#257;</span></h3>

<p>The text of this narrative is written in the hieratic character
upon a papyrus preserved in St. Petersburg; it gives
an excellent description of the troubles that befell the priest
Unu-Amen during his journey into Syria in the second half
of the eleventh century before Christ. The text reads:</p>

<p>On the eighteenth day of the third month of the season of
the Inundation, of the fifth year, Unu-Amen, the senior
priest of the Hait chamber of the house of Amen, the Lord
of the thrones of the Two Lands, set out on his journey to
bring back wood for the great and holy Boat of Amen-R&#257;,
the King of the Gods, which is called "User-hat," and
floateth on the canal of Amen. On the day wherein I arrived
at Tch&#257;n (Tanis or Zoan), the territory of Nessubanebtet
(<i>i.e.</i> King Smendes) and Thent-Amen, I delivered unto
them the credentials which I had received from Amen-R&#257;,
the King of the Gods, and when they had had my letters
read before them, they said, "We will certainly do whatsoever
Amen-R&#257;, the King of the Gods, our Lord, commandeth."
And I lived in that place until the fourth month of
the season of the Inundation, and I abode in the palace at
Zoan. Then Nessubanebtet and Thent-Amen despatched
me with the captain of the large ship called Menkabuta, and
I set sail on the sea of Kharu (Syria) on the first day of the
fourth month of the Season of the Inundation. I arrived at
Dhir, a city of Tchakaru, and Badhilu, its prince, made his
servants bring me bread-cakes by the ten thousand, and a
large jar of wine, and a leg of beef. And a man who belonged
to the crew of my boat ran away, having stolen vessels of
gold that weighed five <i>teben</i>, and four vessels of silver that
weighed twenty <i>teben</i>, and silver in a leather bag that weighed
eleven <i>teben</i>; thus he stole five <i>teben</i> of gold and thirty-one
<i>teben</i> of silver.</p>

<p>On the following morning I rose up, and I went to the place
where the prince of the country was, and I said unto him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_186" id="Pg_186" title="Pg_186">[186]</a></span>"I have been robbed in thy port. Since thou art the prince
of this land, and the leader thereof, thou must make search
and find out what hath become of my money. I swear unto
thee that the money [once] belonged to Amen-R&#257;, King of
the Gods, the Lord of the Two Lands; it belonged to Nessubanebtet,
it belonged to my lord Her-Heru, and to the other
great kings of Egypt, but it now belongeth to Uartha, and
to Makam&#257;ru, and to Tchakar-B&#257;l, Prince of Kepuna (Byblos)."
And he said unto me, "Be angry or be pleased, [as
thou likest], but, behold, I know absolutely nothing about
the matter of which thou speakest unto me. Had the thief
been a man who was a subject of mine, who had gone
down into thy ship and stolen thy money, I would in that
case have made good thy loss from the moneys in my own
treasury, until such time as it had been found out who it
was that robbed thee, and what his name was, but the thief
who hath robbed thee belongeth to thine own ship. Yet
tarry here for a few days, and stay with me, so that I may
seek him out." So I tarried there for nine days, and my
ship lay at anchor in his port. And I went to him and I
said unto him, "Verily thou hast not found my money,
[but I must depart] with the captain of the ship and with
those who are travelling with him." ... [The text here is
mutilated, but from the fragments of the lines that remain
it seems clear that Unu-Amen left the port of Dhir, and proceeded
in his ship to Tyre. After a short stay there he left
Tyre very early one morning and sailed to Kepuna (Byblos),
so that he might have an interview with the governor of that
town, who was called Tchakar-B&#257;l. During his interview
with Tchakar-B&#257;l the governor of Tyre produced a bag
containing thirty <i>teben</i> of silver, and Unu-Amen promptly
seized it, and declared that he intended to keep it until his
own money which had been stolen was returned to him.
Whilst Unu-Amen was at Byblos he buried in some secret
place the image of the god Amen and the amulets belonging
to it, which he had brought with him to protect him and to
guide him on his way. The name of this image was "Amen-ta-mat."
The text then proceeds in a connected form thus:]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_187" id="Pg_187" title="Pg_187">[187]</a></span>And I passed nineteen days in the port of Byblos, and the
governor passed his days in sending messages to me each
day, saying, "Get thee gone out of my harbour." Now on
one occasion when he was making an offering to his gods,
the god took possession of a certain young chief of his chiefs,
and he caused him to fall into a fit of frenzy, and the young
man said, "Bring up the god.<a name="FNanchor_1_151" id="FNanchor_1_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_151" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Bring the messenger who
hath possession of him. Make him to set out on his way.
Make him to depart immediately." Now the man who had
been seized with the fit of divine frenzy continued to be moved
by the same during the night. And I found a certain ship,
which was bound for Egypt, and when I had transferred to
it all my property, I cast a glance at the darkness, saying,
"If the darkness increaseth I will transfer the god to the
ship also, and not permit any other eye whatsoever to look
upon him." Then the superintendent of the harbour came
unto me, saying, "Tarry thou here until to-morrow morning,
according to the orders of the governor." And I said
unto him, "Art not thou thyself he who hath passed his
days in coming to me daily and saying, 'Get thee gone out
of my harbour?' Dost thou not say, 'Tarry here,' so that
I may let the ship which I have found [bound for Egypt]
depart, when thou wilt again come and say, 'Haste thee
to be gone'?"</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_151" id="Footnote_1_151"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_151"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <i>i.e.</i> the figure of Amen-ta-mat.</p></div>

<p>And the superintendent of the harbour turned away and
departed, and told the governor what I had said. And the
governor sent a message to the captain of the ship bound
for Egypt, saying, "Tarry till the morning; these are the
orders of the governor." And when the morning had come,
the governor sent a messenger, who took me to the place
where offerings were being made to the god in the fortress
wherein the governor lived on the sea coast. And I found
him seated in his upper chamber, and he was reclining with
his back towards an opening in the wall, and the waves of
the great Syrian sea were rolling in from seawards and breaking
on the shore behind him. And I said unto him, "The
grace of Amen [be with thee]!" And he said unto me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_188" id="Pg_188" title="Pg_188">[188]</a></span>"Including this day, how long is it since thou camest from
the place where Amen is?" And I said unto him, "Five
months and one day, including to-day." And he said unto
me, "Verily if that which thou sayest is true, where are the
letters of Amen which ought to be in thy hand? Where
are the letters of the high priest of Amen which ought to be
in thy hand?"</p>

<p>And I said unto him, "I gave them to Nessubanebtet
and Thent-Amen." Then was he very angry indeed, and he
said unto me, "Verily, there are neither letters nor writings
in thy hands for us! Where is the ship made of acacia wood
which Nessubanebtet gave unto thee? Where are his Syrian
sailors? Did he not hand thee over to the captain of the
ship so that after thou hadst started on thy journey they
might kill thee and cast thee into the sea? Whose permission
did they seek to attack the god? And indeed
whose permission were they seeking before they attacked
thee?" This is what he said unto me.</p>

<p>And I said unto him, "The ship [wherein I sailed] was in
very truth an Egyptian ship, and it had a crew of Egyptian
sailors who sailed it on behalf of Nessubanebtet. There
were no Syrian sailors placed on board of it by him." He
said unto me, "I swear that there are twenty ships lying in
my harbour, the captains of which are in partnership with
Nessubanebtet. And as for the city of Sidon, whereto thou
wishest to travel, I swear that there are there ten thousand
other ships, the captains of which are in partnership with
Uarkathar, and they are sailed for the benefit of his house."
At this grave moment I held my peace. And he answered
and said unto me, "On what matter of business hast thou
come hither?" And I said unto him, "The matter concerning
which I have come is wood for the great and holy
Boat of Amen-R&#257;, the King of the Gods. What thy father
did [for the god], and what thy father's father did for him,
do thou also." That was what I said unto him. And he
said unto me, "They certainly did do work for it (<i>i.e.</i> the
boat). Give me a gift for my work for the boat, and then
I also will work for it. Assuredly my father and my grandfather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_189" id="Pg_189" title="Pg_189">[189]</a></span>did do the work that was demanded of them, and
Pharaoh, life, strength, and health be to him! caused six
ships laden with the products of Egypt to come hither, and
the contents thereof were unloaded into their storehouses.
Now, thou must most certainly cause some goods to be
brought and given to me for myself."</p>

<p>Then he caused to be brought the books which his father
had kept day by day, and he had them read out before me,
and it was found that one thousand <i>teben</i> of silver of all kinds
were [entered] in his books. And he said unto me, "If the
Ruler of Egypt had been the lord of my possessions, and if
I had indeed been his servant, he would never have had silver
and gold brought [to pay my father and my father's father]
when he told them to carry out the commands of Amen.
The instructions which they (<i>i.e.</i> Pharaoh) gave to my father
were by no means the command of one who was their king.
As for me, I am assuredly not thy servant, and indeed I am
not the servant of him that made thee to set out on thy
way. If I were to cry out now, and to shout to the cedars of
Lebanon, the heavens would open, and the trees would be
lying spread out on the sea-shore. I ask thee now to show
me the sails which thou hast brought to carry thy ships
which shall be loaded with thy timber to Egypt. And show
me also the tackle with which thou wilt transfer to thy ships
the trees which I shall cut down for thee for.... [Unless
I make for thee the tackle] and the sails of thy ships, the
tops will be too heavy, and they will snap off, and thou wilt
perish in the midst of the sea, [especially if] Amen uttereth
his voice in the sky,<a name="FNanchor_1_152" id="FNanchor_1_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_152" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and he unfettereth Sutekh<a name="FNanchor_2_153" id="FNanchor_2_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_153" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> at the
moment when he rageth. Now Amen hath assumed the
overlordship of all lands, and he hath made himself their
master, but first and foremost he is the overlord of Egypt,
whence thou hast come. Excellent things have come forth
from Egypt, and have reached even unto this place wherein
I am; and moreover, knowledge (or learning) hath come
forth therefrom, and hath reached even unto this place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_190" id="Pg_190" title="Pg_190">[190]</a></span>wherein I am. But of what use is this beggarly journey
of thine which thou hast been made to take?"</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_152" id="Footnote_1_152"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_152"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <i>i.e.</i> if there is thunder.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_153" id="Footnote_2_153"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_153"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Here the Storm-god.</p></div>

<p>And I said unto him, "What a shameful thing [to say]!
It is not a beggarly journey whereon I have been despatched
by those among whom I live. And besides, assuredly there
is not a single boat that floateth that doth not belong to
Amen. To him belong the sea and the cedars of Lebanon,
concerning which thou sayest, 'They are my property.'
In Lebanon groweth [the wood] for the Boat Amen-userhat,
the lord of boats. Amen-R&#257;, the King of the Gods, spake
and told Her-Heru, my lord, to send me forth; and therefore
he caused me to set out on my journey together with
this great god.<a name="FNanchor_1_154" id="FNanchor_1_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_154" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Now behold, thou hast caused this great
god to pass nine and twenty days here in a boat that is lying
at anchor in thy harbour, for most assuredly thou didst know
that he was resting here. Amen is now what he hath always
been, and yet thou wouldst dare to stand up and haggle
about the [cedars of] Lebanon with the god who is their
lord! And as concerning what thou hast spoken, saying,
'The kings of Egypt in former times caused silver and gold
to be brought [to my father and father's father, thou art
mistaken].' Since they had bestowed upon them life and
health, they would never have caused gold and silver to be
brought to them; but they might have caused gold and silver
to be brought to thy fathers instead of life and health. And
Amen-R&#257;, the King of the Gods, is the Lord of life and health.
He was the god of thy fathers, and they served him all their
lives, and made offerings unto him, and indeed thou thyself
art a servant of Amen. If now thou wilt say unto Amen,
'I will perform thy commands, I will perform thy commands,'
and wilt bring this business to a prosperous ending,
thou shalt live, thou shalt be strong, thou shalt be healthy,
and thou shalt rule thy country to its uttermost limits wisely
and well, and thou shalt do good to thy people. But take
good heed that thou lovest not the possessions of Amen-R&#257;,
the King of the Gods, for the lion loveth the things that
belong unto him. And now, I pray thee to allow my scribe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_191" id="Pg_191" title="Pg_191">[191]</a></span>to be summoned to me, and I will send him to Nessubanebtet
and Thent-Amen, the local governors whom Amen hath
appointed to rule the northern portion of his land, and they
will send to me everything which I shall tell them to send to
me, saying, 'Let such and such a thing be brought,' until
such time as I can make the journey to the South (<i>i.e.</i> to
Egypt), when I will have thy miserable dross brought to thee,
even to the uttermost portion thereof, in very truth." That
was what I said unto him.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_154" id="Footnote_1_154"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_154"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <i>i.e.</i> the figure of Amen already referred to.</p></div>

<p>And he gave my letter into the hand of his ambassador.
And he loaded up on a ship wood for the fore part and wood
for the hind part [of the Boat of Amen], and four other trunks
of cedar trees which had been cut down, in all seven trunks,
and he despatched them to Egypt. And his ambassador
departed to Egypt, and he returned to me in Syria in the
first month of the winter season (November-December).
And Nessubanebtet and Thent-Amen sent to me five vessels
of gold, five vessels of silver, ten pieces of byssus, each sufficiently
large to make a suit of raiment, five hundred rolls of
fine papyrus, five hundred hides of oxen, five hundred ropes,
twenty sacks of lentils, and thirty vessels full of dried fish.
And for my personal use they sent to me five pieces of byssus,
each sufficiently large to make a suit of raiment, a sack of
lentils, and five vessels full of dried fish. Then the Governor
was exceedingly glad and rejoiced greatly, and he sent three
hundred men and three hundred oxen [to Lebanon] to cut
down the cedar trees, and he appointed overseers to direct
them. And they cut down the trees, the trunks of which
lay there during the whole of the winter season. And
when the third month of the summer season had come,
they dragged the tree trunks down to the sea-shore.
And the Governor came out of his palace, and took up
his stand before the trunks, and he sent a message to
me, saying, "Come." Now as I was passing close by
him, the shadow of his umbrella fell upon me, whereupon
Pen-Amen, an officer of his bodyguard, placed himself
between him and me, saying, "The shadow of Pharaoh,
life, strength, and health, be to him! thy Lord, falleth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_192" id="Pg_192" title="Pg_192">[192]</a></span>upon thee."<a name="FNanchor_1_155" id="FNanchor_1_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_155" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And the Governor was wroth with Pen-Amen,
and he said, "Let him alone." Therefore I walked
close to him.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_155" id="Footnote_1_155"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_155"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Pen-Amen means to say that as the shadow of the Governor had fallen
upon the Egyptian, Unu-Amen was henceforth his servant. The shadow
of a man was supposed to carry with it some of the vital power and authority
of the man.</p></div>

<p>And the Governor answered and said unto me, "Behold,
the orders [of Pharaoh] which my fathers carried out in times
of old, I also have carried out, notwithstanding the fact that
thou hast not done for me what thy fathers were wont to do
for me. However, look for thyself, and take note that the
last of the cedar trunks hath arrived, and here it lieth. Do
now whatsoever thou pleaseth with them, and take steps to
load them into ships, for assuredly they are given to thee as
a gift. I beg thee to pay no heed to the terror of the sea
voyage, but if thou persistest in contemplating [with fear]
the sea voyage, thou must also contemplate [with fear] the
terror of me [if thou tarriest here]. Certainly I have not
treated thee as the envoys of Kh&#257;-em-Uast<a name="FNanchor_1_156" id="FNanchor_1_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_156" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> were treated
here, for they were made to pass seventeen (or fifteen) years
in this country, and they died here."<a name="FNanchor_2_157" id="FNanchor_2_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_157" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_156" id="Footnote_1_156"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_156"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Otherwise known as Rameses IX, a king of the twentieth dynasty.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_157" id="Footnote_2_157"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_157"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> <i>i.e.</i> they were kept prisoners in Syria until their death.</p></div>

<p>Then the Governor spake to the officer of his bodyguard,
saying, "Lay hands on him, and take him to see the tombs
wherein they lie." And I said unto him, "Far be it from me
to look upon such [ill-omened] things! As concerning the
messengers of Kh&#257;-em-Uast, the men whom he sent unto
thee as ambassadors were merely [officials] of his, and there
was no god with his ambassadors, and so thou sayest, 'Make
haste to look upon thy colleagues.' Behold, wouldst thou
not have greater pleasure, and shouldst thou not [instead of
saying such things] cause to be made a stele whereon should
be said by thee:</p>

<p>"Amen-R&#257;, the King of the Gods, sent to me Amen-ta-mat,
his divine ambassador, together with Unu-Amen,
his human ambassador, in quest of trunks of cedar wood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_193" id="Pg_193" title="Pg_193">[193]</a></span>for the Great and Holy Boat of Amen-R&#257;, the King of the
Gods. And I cut down cedar trees, and I loaded them
into ships. I provided the ships myself, and I manned them
with my own sailors, and I made them to arrive in Egypt
that they might bespeak [from the god for me] ten thousand
years of life, in addition to the span of life which was decreed
for me. And this petition hath been granted.</p>

<p>"[And wouldst thou not rather] that, after the lapse of
time, when another ambassador came from the land of
Egypt who understood this writing, he should utter thy
name which should be on the stele, and pray that thou
shouldst receive water in Amentet, even like the gods who
subsist?"</p>

<p>And he said unto me, "These words which thou hast
spoken unto me are of a certainty a great testimony." And
I said unto him, "Now, as concerning the multitude of words
which thou hast spoken unto me: As soon as I arrive at
the place where the First Prophet (<i>i.e.</i> Her-Heru) of Amen
dwelleth, and he knoweth [how thou hast] performed the
commands of the God [Amen], he will cause to be conveyed
to thee [a gift of] certain things." Then I walked down to
the beach, to the place where the trunks of cedar had been
lying, and I saw eleven ships [ready] to put out to sea; and
they belonged to Tchakar-B&#257;l. [And the governor sent
out an order] saying, "Stop him, and do not let any ship
with him on board [depart] to the land of Egypt." Then
I sat myself down and wept. And the scribe of the Governor
came out to me, and said unto me, "What aileth thee?"
And I said unto him, "Consider the <i>kashu</i> birds that fly to
Egypt again and again! And consider how they flock to
the cool water brooks! Until the coming of whom must I
remain cast aside hither? Assuredly thou seest those who
have come to prevent my departure a second time."</p>

<p>Then [the scribe] went away and told the Governor what
I had said; and the Governor shed tears because of the
words that had been repeated to him, for they were full of
pain. And he caused the scribe to come out to me again,
and he brought with him two skins [full] of wine and a goat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_194" id="Pg_194" title="Pg_194">[194]</a></span>And he caused to be brought out to me Thentmut, an Egyptian
singing woman who lived in his house, and he said to
her, "Sing to him, and let not the cares of his business lay
hold upon his heart." And to me he sent a message, saying,
"Eat and drink, and let not business lay hold upon thy
heart. Thou shalt hear everything which I have to say unto
thee to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>And when the morning had come, he caused [the inhabitants
of the town] to be assembled on the quay, and having
stood up in their midst, he said to the Tchakaru, "For what
purpose have ye come hither?" And they said unto him,
"We have come hither seeking for the ships which have been
broken and dashed to pieces, that is to say, the ships which
thou didst despatch to Egypt, with our unfortunate fellow-sailors
in them." And he said unto them, "I know not how
to detain the ambassador of Amen in my country any longer.
I beg of you to let me send him away, and then do ye pursue
him, and prevent him [from escaping]." And he made me
embark in a ship, and sent me forth from the sea-coast, and
the winds drove me ashore to the land of Alasu (Cyprus?).
And the people of the city came forth to slay me, and I was
dragged along in their midst to the place where their queen
Hathaba lived; and I met her when she was coming forth
from one house to go into another. Then I cried out in
entreaty to her, and I said unto the people who were standing
about her, "Surely there must be among you someone who
understandeth the language of Egypt." And one of them
said, "I understand the speech [of Egypt]." Then I said
unto him, "Tell my Lady these words: I have heard it said
far from here, even in the city of [Thebes], the place where
Amen dwelleth, that wrong is done in every city, and that
only in the land of Alasu (Cyprus?) is right done. And yet
wrong is done here every day!" And she said, "What is
it that thou really wishest to say?" I said unto her, "Now
that the angry sea and the winds have cast me up on the land
wherein thou dwellest, thou wilt surely not permit these men
who have received me to slay me! Moreover, I am an
ambassador of Amen. And consider carefully, for I am a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_195" id="Pg_195" title="Pg_195">[195]</a></span>man who will be searched for every day. And as for the
sailors of Byblos whom they wish to kill, if their lord findeth
ten of thy sailors he will assuredly slay them." Then she
caused her people to be called off me, and they were made to
stand still, and she said unto me, "Lie down and sleep...."

<h3>FAIRY TALES<br /><br /></h3>


<p>One of the most interesting tales that have come down to
us in Egyptian dress is the tale commonly called the "<b>Tale
of the Two Brothers</b>." It is found written in the hieratic
character upon a papyrus preserved in the British Museum
(D'Orbiney, No. 10,183), and the form which the story has
there is that which was current under the nineteenth dynasty,
about 1300 B.C. The two principal male characters in the
story, Anpu and Bata, were originally gods, but in the hands
of the Egyptian story-teller they became men, and their
deeds were treated in such a way as to form an interesting
fairy story. It is beyond the scope of this little book to treat
of the mythological ideas that underlie certain parts of the
narrative, and we therefore proceed to give a rendering of
this very curious and important "fairy tale."<br /><br /></p>

<p>It is said that there were two brothers, [the children] of
one mother and of one father; the name of the elder was
Anpu, and Bata was the name of the younger. Anpu had a
house and a wife, and Bata lived with him like a younger
brother. It was Bata who made the clothes; he tended and
herded his cattle in the fields, he ploughed the land, he did
the hard work during the time of harvest, and he kept
the account of everything that related to the fields. And
Bata was a most excellent farmer, and his like there was not
in the whole country-side; and behold, the power of the God
was in him. And very many days passed during which
Anpu's young brother tended his flocks and herds daily, and
he returned to his house each evening loaded with field produce
of every kind. And when he had returned from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_197" id="Pg_197" title="Pg_197">[197]</a></span>fields, he set [food] before his elder brother, who sat with his
wife drinking and eating, and then Bata went out to the byre
and [slept] with the cattle. On the following morning as
soon as it was day, Bata took bread-cakes newly baked, and
set them before Anpu, who gave him food to take with him
to the fields. Then Bata drove out his cattle into the fields
to feed, and [as] he walked behind them they said unto him,
"The pasturage is good in such and such a place," and he
listened to their voices, and took them where they wished to
go. Thus the cattle in Bata's charge became exceedingly
fine, and their calves doubled in number, and they multiplied
exceedingly. And when it was the season for ploughing Anpu
said unto Bata, "Come, let us get our teams ready for ploughing
the fields, and our implements, for the ground hath
appeared,<a name="FNanchor_1_158" id="FNanchor_1_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_158" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and it is in the proper condition for the plough.
Go to the fields and take the seed-corn with thee to-day, and
at daybreak to-morrow we will do the ploughing"; this is
what he said to him. And Bata did everything which Anpu
had told him to do. The next morning, as soon as it was
daylight, the two brothers went into the fields with their
teams and their ploughs, and they ploughed the land, and they
were exceedingly happy as they ploughed, from the beginning
of their work to the very end thereof.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_158" id="Footnote_1_158"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_158"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <i>i.e.</i> the waters of the Inundation had subsided, leaving the ground
visible.</p></div>

<p>Now when the two brothers had been living in this way
for a considerable time, they were in the fields one day
[ploughing], and Anpu said to Bata, "Run back to the farm
and fetch some [more] seed corn." And Bata did so, and
when he arrived there he found his brother's wife seated
dressing her hair. And he said to her, "Get up and give
me some seed corn that I may hurry back to the fields, for
Anpu ordered me not to loiter on the way." Anpu's wife
said to him, "Go thyself to the grain shed, and open the bin,
and take out from it as much corn as thou wishest; I could
fetch it for thee myself, only I am afraid that my hair would
fall down on the way." Then the young man went to the
bin, and filled a very large jar full of grain, for it was his desire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_198" id="Pg_198" title="Pg_198">[198]</a></span>to carry off a large quantity of seed corn, and he lifted up on
his shoulders the pot, which was filled full of wheat and barley,
and came out of the shed with it. And Anpu's wife said to
him, "How much grain hast thou on thy shoulders?" And
Bata said to her, "Three measures of barley and two measures
of wheat, in all five measures of grain; that is what I have
on my shoulders." These were the words which he spake
to her. And she said to him, "How strong thou art! I
have been observing thy vigorousness day by day." And
her heart inclined to him, and she entreated him to stay with
her, promising to give him beautiful apparel if he would
do so. Then the young man became filled with fury like a
panther of the south because of her words, and when she saw
how angry he was she became terribly afraid. And he said
to her, "Verily thou art to me as my mother, and thy husband
is as my father, and being my elder brother he hath provided
me with the means of living. Thou hast said unto me what
ought not to have been said, and I pray thee not to repeat
it. On my part I shall tell no man of it, and on thine thou
must never declare the matter to man or woman." Then
Bata took up his load on his shoulders, and departed to
the fields. And when he arrived at the place where his elder
brother was they continued their ploughing and laboured
diligently at their work.</p>

<p>And when the evening was come the elder brother returned
to his house. And having loaded himself with the products
of the fields, Bata drove his flocks and herds back to the farm
and put them in their enclosures.</p>

<p>And behold, Anpu's wife was smitten with fear, because
of the words which she had spoken to Bata, and she took
some grease and a piece of linen, and she made herself to
appear like a woman who had been assaulted, and who had
been violently beaten by her assailant, for she wished to say
to her husband, "Thy young brother hath beaten me sorely."
And when Anpu returned in the evening according to his
daily custom, and arrived at his house, he found his wife
lying on the ground in the condition of one who had been
assaulted with violence. She did not [appear to] pour water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_199" id="Pg_199" title="Pg_199">[199]</a></span>over his hands according to custom, she did not light a light
before him; his house was in darkness, and she was lying
prostrate and sick. And her husband said unto her, "Who
hath been talking to thee?" And she said unto him, "No
one hath been talking to me except thy young brother. When
he came to fetch the seed corn he found me sitting alone,
and he spake words of love to me, and he told me to tie up
my hair. But I would not listen to him, and I said to him,
'Am I not like thy mother? Is not thy elder brother like
thy father?' Then he was greatly afraid, and he beat me
to prevent me from telling thee about this matter. Now,
if thou dost not kill him I shall kill myself, for since I have
complained to thee about his words, when he cometh back
in the evening what he will do [to me] is manifest."</p>

<p>Then the elder brother became like a panther of the
southern desert with wrath. And he seized his dagger, and
sharpened it, and went and stood behind the stable door, so
that he might slay Bata when he returned in the evening
and came to the byre to bring in his cattle. And when the
sun was about to set Bata loaded himself with products of
the field of every kind, according to his custom, [and returned
to the farm]. And as he was coming back the cow that led
the herd said to Bata as she was entering the byre, "Verily
thy elder brother is waiting with his dagger to slay thee;
flee thou from before him"; and Bata hearkened to the
words of the leading cow. And when the second cow as she
was about to enter into the byre spake unto him even as did
the first cow, Bata looked under the door of the byre, and
saw the feet of his elder brother as he stood behind the door
with his dagger in his hand. Then he set down his load upon
the ground, and he ran away as fast as he could run, and Anpu
followed him grasping his dagger. And Bata cried out to
R&#257;-Harmakhis (the Sun-god) and said, "O my fair Lord,
thou art he who judgeth between the wrong and the right."
And the god R&#257; hearkened unto all his words, and he caused
a great stream to come into being, and to separate the two
brothers, and the water was filled with crocodiles. Now
Anpu was on one side of the stream and Bata on the other,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_200" id="Pg_200" title="Pg_200">[200]</a></span>and Anpu wrung his hands together in bitter wrath because
he could not kill his brother. Then Bata cried out to Anpu
on the other bank, saying, "Stay where thou art until daylight,
and until the Disk (<i>i.e.</i> the Sun-god) riseth. I will enter
into judgment with thee in his presence, for it is he who
setteth right what is wrong. I shall never more live with
thee, and I shall never again dwell in the place where thou
art. I am going to the Valley of the Acacia."</p>

<p>And when the day dawned, and there was light on the earth,
and R&#257;-Harmakhis was shining, the two brothers looked
at each other. And Bata spake unto Anpu, saying, "Why
hast thou pursued me in this treacherous way, wishing to
slay me without first hearing what I had to say? I am thy
brother, younger than thou art, and thou art as a father and
thy wife is as a mother to me. Is it not so? When thou
didst send me to fetch seed corn for our work, it was thy wife
who said, 'I pray thee to stay with me,' but behold, the facts
have been misrepresented to thee, and the reverse of what
happened hath been put before thee." Then Bata explained
everything to Anpu, and made him to understand exactly
what had taken place between him and his brother's wife.
And Bata swore an oath by R&#257;-Harmakhis, saying, "By R&#257;-Harmakhis,
to lie in wait for me and to pursue me, with thy
knife in thy hand ready to slay me, was a wicked and abominable
thing to do." And Bata took [from his side] the knife
which he used in cutting reeds, and drove it into his body,
and he sank down fainting upon the ground. Then Anpu
cursed himself with bitter curses, and he lifted up his voice
and wept; and he did not know how to cross over the stream
to the bank where Bata was because of the crocodiles. And
Bata cried out to him, saying, "Behold, thou art ready to
remember against me one bad deed of mine, but thou dost not
remember my good deeds, or even one of the many things
that have been done for thee by me. Shame on thee! Get
thee back to thy house and tend thine own cattle, for I will
no longer stay with thee. I will depart to the Valley of the
Acacia. But thou shalt come to minister to me, therefore
take heed to what I say. Now know that certain things are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_201" id="Pg_201" title="Pg_201">[201]</a></span>about to happen to me. I am going to cast a spell on my
heart, so that I may be able to place it on a flower of the
Acacia tree. When this Acacia is cut down my heart shall
fall to the ground, and thou shalt come to seek for it. Thou
shalt pass seven years in seeking for it, but let not thy heart
be sick with disappointment, for thou shalt find it. When
thou findest it, place it in a vessel of cold water, and verily
my heart shall live again, and shall make answer to him that
attacketh me. And thou shalt know what hath happened
to me [by the following sign]. A vessel of beer shall be
placed in thy hand, and it shall froth and run over; and
another vessel with wine in it shall be placed [in thy hand],
and it shall become sour. Then make no tarrying, for indeed
these things shall happen to thee." So the younger brother
departed to the Valley of the Acacia, and the elder brother
departed to his house. And Anpu's hand was laid upon his
head, and he cast dust upon himself [in grief for Bata], and
when he arrived at his house he slew his wife, and threw her to
the dogs, and he sat down and mourned for his young brother.</p>

<p>And when many days had passed, Bata was living alone
in the Valley of the Acacia, and he spent his days in hunting
the wild animals of the desert; and at night he slept under
the Acacia, on the top of the flowers of which rested his
heart. And after many days he built himself, with his own
hand, a large house in the Valley of the Acacia, and it was
filled with beautiful things of every kind, for he delighted in
the possession of a house. And as he came forth [one day]
from his house, he met the Company of the Gods, and they
were on their way to work out their plans in their realm.
And one of them said unto him, "Hail, Bata, thou Bull of
the gods, hast thou not been living here alone since the time
when thou didst forsake thy town through the wife of thy
elder brother Anpu? Behold, his wife hath been slain [by
him], and moreover thou hast made an adequate answer to
the attack which he made upon thee"; and their hearts were
very sore indeed for Bata. Then R&#257;-Harmakhis said unto
Khnemu,<a name="FNanchor_1_159" id="FNanchor_1_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_159" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> "Fashion a wife for Bata, so that thou, O Bata,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_202" id="Pg_202" title="Pg_202">[202]</a></span>mayest not dwell alone." And Khnemu made a wife to live
with Bata, and her body was more beautiful than the body
of any other woman in the whole country, and the essence
of every god was in her; and the Seven Hathor Goddesses
came to her, and they said, "She shall die by the sword."
And Bata loved her most dearly, and she lived in his house,
and he passed all his days in hunting the wild animals of the
desert so that he might bring them and lay them before her.
And he said to her, "Go not out of the house lest the River
carry thee off, for I know not how to deliver thee from it.
My heart is set upon the flower of the Acacia, and if any man
find it I must do battle with him for it"; and he told her
everything that had happened concerning his heart.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_159" id="Footnote_1_159"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_159"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The god who fashioned the bodies of men.</p></div>

<p>And many days afterwards, when Bata had gone out
hunting as usual, the young woman went out of the house
and walked under the Acacia tree, which was close by, and
the River saw her, and sent its waters rolling after her; and
she fled before them and ran away into her house. And the
River said, "I love her," and the Acacia took to the River a
lock of her hair, and the River carried it to Egypt, and cast
it up on the bank at the place where the washermen washed
the clothes of Pharaoh, life, strength, health [be to him]!
And the odour of the lock of hair passed into the clothing of
Pharaoh. Then the washermen of Pharaoh quarrelled among
themselves, saying, "There is an odour [as of] perfumed oil
in the clothes of Pharaoh." And quarrels among them went
on daily, and at length they did not know what they were
doing. And the overseer of the washermen of Pharaoh
walked to the river bank, being exceedingly angry because
of the quarrels that came before him daily, and he stood still
on the spot that was exactly opposite to the lock of hair as
it lay in the water. Then he sent a certain man into the
water to fetch it, and when he brought it back, the overseer,
finding that it had an exceedingly sweet odour, took it to
Pharaoh. And the scribes and the magicians were summoned
into the presence of Pharaoh, and they said to him, "This
lock of hair belongeth to a maiden of R&#257;-Harmakhis, and
the essence of every god is in her. It cometh to thee from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_203" id="Pg_203" title="Pg_203">[203]</a></span>strange land as a salutation of praise to thee. We therefore
pray thee send ambassadors into every land to seek her out.
And as concerning the ambassador to the Valley of the Acacia,
we beg thee to send a strong escort with him to fetch her."
And His Majesty said unto them, "What we have decided
is very good," and he despatched the ambassadors.</p>

<p>And when many days had passed by, the ambassadors
who had been despatched to foreign lands returned to make
a report to His Majesty, but those who had gone to the Valley
of the Acacia did not come back, for Bata had slain them,
with the exception of one who returned to tell the matter to
His Majesty. Then His Majesty despatched foot-soldiers
and horsemen and charioteers to bring back the young woman,
and there was also with them a woman who had in her hands
beautiful trinkets of all kinds, such as are suitable for maidens,
to give to the young woman. And this woman returned to
Egypt with the young woman, and everyone in all parts of
the country rejoiced at her arrival. And His Majesty loved
her exceedingly, and he paid her homage as the Great August
One, the Chief Wife. And he spake to her and made her tell
him what had become of her husband, and she said to His
Majesty, "I pray thee to cut down the Acacia Tree and then
to destroy it." Then the King caused men and bowmen to
set out with axes to cut down the Acacia, and when they
arrived in the Valley of the Acacia, they cut down the flower
on which was the heart of Bata, and he fell down dead at
that very moment of evil.</p>

<p>And on the following morning when the light had come
upon the earth, and the Acacia had been cut down, Anpu,
Bata's elder brother, went into his house and sat down, and
he washed his hands; and one gave him a vessel of beer, and
it frothed up, and the froth ran over, and one gave him
another vessel containing wine, and it was sour. Then he
grasped his staff, and [taking] his sandals, and his apparel,
and his weapons which he used in fighting and hunting, he
set out to march to the Valley of the Acacia. And when he
arrived there he went into Bata's house, and he found his
young brother there lying dead on his bed; and when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_204" id="Pg_204" title="Pg_204">[204]</a></span>looked upon his young brother he wept on seeing that he was
dead. Then he set out to seek for the heart of Bata, under
the Acacia where he was wont to sleep at night, and he passed
three years in seeking for it but found it not. And when
the fourth year of his search had begun, his heart craved to
return to Egypt, and he said, "I will depart thither to-morrow
morning"; that was what he said to himself. And on the
following day he walked about under the Acacia all day long
looking for Bata's heart, and as he was returning [to the
house] in the evening, and was looking about him still searching
for it, he found a seed, which he took back with him, and
behold, it was Bata's heart. Then he fetched a vessel of
cold water, and having placed the seed in it, he sat down
according to his custom. And when the night came, the heart
had absorbed all the water; and Bata [on his bed] trembled
in all his members, and he looked at Anpu, whilst his heart
remained in the vessel of water. And Anpu took up the
vessel wherein was his brother's heart, which had absorbed
the water. And Bata's heart ascended its throne [in his
body], and Bata became as he had been aforetime, and the
two brothers embraced each other, and each spake to the
other.</p>

<p>And Bata said to Anpu, "Behold, I am about to take the
form of a great bull, with beautiful hair, and a disposition (?)
which is unknown. When the sun riseth, do thou mount on
my back, and we will go to the place where my wife is, and
I will make answer [for myself]. Then shalt thou take me
to the place where the King is, for he will bestow great favours
upon thee, and he will heap gold and silver upon thee because
thou wilt have brought me to him. For I am going to become
a great and wonderful thing, and men and women shall
rejoice because of me throughout the country." And on the
following day Bata changed himself into the form of which
he had spoken to his brother. Then Anpu seated himself
on his back early in the morning, and when he had come to
the place where the King was, and His Majesty had been
informed concerning him, he looked at him, and he had very
great joy in him. And he made a great festival, saying,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_205" id="Pg_205" title="Pg_205">[205]</a></span>"This is a very great wonder which hath happened"; and
the people rejoiced everywhere throughout the whole country.
And Pharaoh loaded Anpu with silver and gold, and he dwelt
in his native town, and the King gave him large numbers of
slaves, and very many possessions, for Pharaoh loved him
very much, far more than any other person in the whole land.</p>

<p>And when many days had passed by the bull went into
the house of purification, and he stood up in the place where
the August Lady was, and said unto her, "Look upon me,
I am alive in very truth." And she said unto him, "Who
art thou?" And he said unto her, "I am Bata. When
thou didst cause the Acacia which held my heart to be destroyed
by Pharaoh, well didst thou know that thou wouldst
kill me. Nevertheless, I am alive indeed, in the form of a
bull. Look at me!" And the August Lady was greatly
afraid because of what she had said concerning her husband
[to the King]; and the bull departed from the place of purification.
And His Majesty went to tarry in her house and
to rejoice with her, and she ate and drank with him; and the
King was exceedingly happy. And the August Lady said
to His Majesty, "Say these words: 'Whatsoever she saith
I will hearken unto for her sake,' and swear an oath by God
that thou wilt do them." And the King hearkened unto
everything which she spake, saying, "I beseech thee to give
me the liver of this bull to eat, for he is wholly useless for any
kind of work." And the King cursed many, many times
the request which she had uttered, and Pharaoh's heart
was exceedingly sore thereat.</p>

<p>On the following morning, when it was day, the King proclaimed
a great feast, and he ordered the bull to be offered
up as an offering, and one of the chief royal slaughterers of
His Majesty was brought to slay the bull. And after the
knife had been driven into him, and whilst he was still on the
shoulders of the men, the bull shook his neck, and two drops
of blood from it fell by the jambs of the doorway of His
Majesty, one by one jamb of Pharaoh's door, and the other
by the other, and they became immediately two mighty
acacia trees, and each was of the greatest magnificence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_206" id="Pg_206" title="Pg_206">[206]</a></span>Then one went and reported to His Majesty, saying, "Two
mighty acacia trees, whereat His Majesty will marvel exceedingly,
have sprung up during the night by the Great Door
of His Majesty." And men and women rejoiced in them
everywhere in the country, and the King made offerings unto
them. And many days after this His Majesty put on his
tiara of lapis-lazuli, and hung a wreath of flowers of every
kind about his neck, and he mounted his chariot of silver-gold,
and went forth from the Palace to see the two acacia
trees. And the August Lady came following after Pharaoh
[in a chariot drawn by] horses, and His Majesty sat down
under one acacia, and the August Lady sat under the other.
And when she had seated herself the Acacia spake unto his
wife, saying, "O woman, who art full of guile, I am Bata,
and I am alive even though thou hast entreated me evilly.
Well didst thou know when thou didst make Pharaoh to cut
down the Acacia that held my heart that thou wouldst kill
me, and when I transformed myself into a bull thou didst
cause me to be slain."</p>

<p>And several days after this the August Lady was eating
and drinking at the table of His Majesty, and the King was
enjoying her society greatly, and she said unto His Majesty,
"Swear to me an oath by God, saying, I will hearken unto
whatsoever the August Lady shall say unto me for her sake;
let her say on." And he hearkened unto everything which
she said, and she said, "I entreat thee to cut down these two
acacia trees, and to let them be made into great beams";
and the King hearkened unto everything which she said.
And several days after this His Majesty made cunning wood-men
to go and cut down the acacia trees of Pharaoh, and whilst
the August Lady was standing and watching their being cut
down, a splinter flew from one of them into her mouth, and
she knew that she had conceived, and the King did for her
everything which her heart desired. And many days after
this happened she brought forth a man child, and one said
to His Majesty, "A man child hath been born unto thee";
and a nurse was found for him and women to watch over
him and tend him, and the people rejoiced throughout the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_207" id="Pg_207" title="Pg_207">[207]</a></span>whole land. And the King sat down to enjoy a feast, and
he began to call the child by his name, and he loved him very
dearly, and at that same time the King gave him the title of
"Royal son of Kash."<a name="FNanchor_1_160" id="FNanchor_1_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_160" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Some time after this His Majesty
appointed him "Erp&#257;"<a name="FNanchor_2_161" id="FNanchor_2_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_161" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of the whole country. And when
he had served the office of Erp&#257; for many years, His Majesty
flew up to heaven (<i>i.e.</i> he died). And the King (<i>i.e.</i> Bata)
said, "Let all the chief princes be summoned before me, so
that I may inform them about everything which hath happened
unto me." And they brought his wife, and he entered
into judgment with her, and the sentence which he passed
upon her was carried out. And Anpu, the brother of the
King, was brought unto His Majesty, and the King made him
Erp&#257; of the whole country. When His Majesty had reigned
over Egypt for twenty years, he departed to life (<i>i.e.</i> he died),
and his brother Anpu took his place on the day in which he
was buried.</p>

<p>Under the heading of this chapter may well be included
the <b>Story of the Shipwrecked Traveller</b>. The text of this
remarkable story is written in the hieratic character upon a
roll of papyrus, which is preserved in the Imperial Library
at St. Petersburg. It is probable that a layer of facts underlies
the story, but the form in which we have it justifies us
in assigning to it a place among the fairy stories of Ancient
Egypt. Prefixed to the narrative of the shipwrecked traveller
is the following:</p>

<p>"A certain servant of wise understanding hath said, Let
thy heart be of good cheer, O prince. Verily we have arrived
at [our] homes. The mallet hath been grasped, and the
anchor-post hath been driven into the ground, and the bow
of the boat hath grounded on the bank. Thanksgivings
have been offered up to God, and every man hath embraced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_208" id="Pg_208" title="Pg_208">[208]</a></span>his neighbour. Our sailors have returned in peace and safety,
and our fighting men have lost none of their comrades, even
though we travelled to the uttermost parts of Uauat (Nubia),
and through the country of Senmut (Northern Nubia).
Verily we have arrived in peace, and we have reached our
own land [again]. Hearken, O prince, unto me, even though
I be a poor man. Wash thyself, and let water run over thy
fingers. I would that thou shouldst be ready to return an
answer to the man who addresseth thee, and to speak to the
King [from] thy heart, and assuredly thou must give thine
answer promptly and without hesitation. The mouth of a
man delivereth him, and his words provide a covering for
[his] face. Act thou according to the promptings of thine
heart, and when thou hast spoken [thou wilt have made him]
to be at rest." The shipwrecked traveller then narrates his
experiences in the following words: I will now speak and
give thee a description of the things that [once] happened to
me myself [when] I was journeying to the copper mines of
the king. I went down into the sea<a name="FNanchor_1_163" id="FNanchor_1_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_163" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in a ship that was one
hundred and fifty cubits (225 feet) in length, and forty cubits
(60 feet) in breadth, and it was manned by one hundred and
fifty sailors who were chosen from among the best sailors of
Egypt. They had looked upon the sky, they had looked
upon the land, and their hearts were more understanding
than the hearts of lions. Now although they were able to
say beforehand when a tempest was coming, and could tell
when a squall was going to rise before it broke upon them,
a storm actually overtook us when we were still on the sea.
Before we could make the land the wind blew with redoubled
violence, and it drove before it upon us a wave that was eight
cubits (12 feet) [high]. A plank was driven towards me by
it, and I seized it; and as for the ship, those who were therein
perished, and not one of them escaped.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_163" id="Footnote_1_163"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_163"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The sea was the Red Sea, and the narrator must have been on his way
to W&#257;d&#299; Magh&#257;rah or Sar&#257;b&#299;t al-Kh&#257;dim in the Peninsula of Sinai.</p></div>

<p>Then a wave of the sea bore me along and cast me up upon
an island, and I passed three days there by myself, with none
but mine own heart for a companion; I laid me down and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_209" id="Pg_209" title="Pg_209">[209]</a></span>slept in a hollow in a thicket, and I hugged the shade. And
I lifted up my legs (<i>i.e.</i> I walked about), so that I might find
out what to put in my mouth, and I found there figs and
grapes, and all kinds of fine large berries; and there were
there gourds, and melons, and pumpkins as large as barrels (?),
and there were also there fish and water-fowl. There was no
[food] of any sort or kind that did not grow in this island.
And when I had eaten all I could eat, I laid the remainder
of the food upon the ground, for it was too much for me [to
carry] in my arms. I then dug a hole in the ground and made
a fire, and I prepared pieces of wood and a burnt-offering
for the gods.</p>

<p>And I heard a sound [as of] thunder, which I thought to
be [caused by] a wave of the sea, and the trees rocked and the
earth quaked, and I covered my face. And I found [that the
sound was caused by] a serpent that was coming towards me.
It was thirty cubits (45 feet) in length, and its beard was more
than two cubits in length, and its body was covered with
[scales of] gold, and the two ridges over its eyes were of
pure lapis-lazuli (<i>i.e.</i> they were blue); and it coiled its whole
length up before me. And it opened its mouth to me, now
I was lying flat on my stomach in front of it, and it said unto
me, "Who hath brought thee hither? Who hath brought
thee hither, O miserable one? Who hath brought thee
hither? If thou dost not immediately declare unto me who
hath brought thee to this island, I will make thee to know
what it is to be burnt with fire, and thou wilt become a thing
that is invisible. Thou speakest to me, but I cannot hear
what thou sayest; I am before thee, dost thou not know
me?" Then the serpent took me in its mouth, and carried
me off to the place where it was wont to rest, and it set me
down there, having done me no harm whatsoever; I was
sound and whole, and it had not carried away any portion
of my body. And it opened its mouth to me whilst I was
lying flat on my stomach, and it said unto me, "Who hath
brought thee thither? Who hath brought thee hither, O
miserable one? Who hath brought thee to this island of
the sea, the two sides of which are in the waves?"</p>

<p>Then I made answer to the serpent, my two hands being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_210" id="Pg_210" title="Pg_210">[210]</a></span>folded humbly before it, and I said unto it, "I am one who
was travelling to the mines on a mission of the king in a
ship that was one hundred and fifty cubits long, and fifty
cubits in breadth, and it was manned by a crew of one hundred
and fifty men, who were chosen from among the best
sailors of Egypt. They had looked upon the sky, they had
looked upon the earth, and their hearts were more understanding
than the hearts of lions. They were able to say
beforehand when a tempest was coming, and to tell when a
squall was about to rise before it broke. The heart of every
man among them was wiser than that of his neighbour, and
the arm of each was stronger than that of his neighbour;
there was not one weak man among them. Nevertheless it
blew a gale of wind whilst we were still on the sea and before
we could make the land. A gale rose, which continued to
increase in violence, and with it there came upon [us] a wave
eight cubits [high]. A plank of wood was driven towards
me by this wave, and I seized it; and as for the ship, those
who were therein perished and not one of them escaped alive
[except] myself. And now behold me by thy side! It was
a wave of the sea that brought me to this island."</p>

<p>And the serpent said unto me, "Have no fear, have no
fear, O little one, and let not thy face be sad, now that thou
hast arrived at the place where I am. Verily, God hath
spared thy life, and thou hast been brought to this island
where there is food. There is no kind of food that is not
here, and it is filled with good things of every kind. Verily,
thou shalt pass month after month on this island, until thou
hast come to the end of four months, and then a ship shall
come, and there shall be therein sailors who are acquaintances
of thine, and thou shalt go with them to thy country, and
thou shalt die in thy native town." [And the serpent continued,]
"What a joyful thing it is for the man who hath
experienced evil fortunes, and hath passed safely through
them, to declare them! I will now describe unto thee some
of the things that have happened unto me on this island.
I used to live here with my brethren, and with my children
who dwelt among them; now my children and my brethren
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_211" id="Pg_211" title="Pg_211">[211]</a></span>together numbered seventy-five. I do not make mention
of a little maiden who had been brought to me by fate. And
a star fell [from heaven], and these (<i>i.e.</i> his children, and his
brethren, and the maiden) came into the fire which fell with
it. I myself was not with those who were burnt in the fire,
and I was not in their midst, but I [well-nigh] died [of grief]
for them. And I found a place wherein I buried them all
together. Now, if thou art strong, and thy heart flourisheth,
thou shalt fill both thy arms (<i>i.e.</i> embrace) with thy children,
and thou shalt kiss thy wife, and thou shalt see thine own
house, which is the most beautiful thing of all, and thou shalt
reach thy country, and thou shalt live therein again together
with thy brethren, and dwell therein."</p>

<p>Then I cast myself down flat upon my stomach, and I
pressed the ground before the serpent with my forehead,
saying, "I will describe thy power to the King, and I will
make him to understand thy greatness. I will cause to be
brought unto thee the unguent and spices called <i>aba</i>, and
<i>hekenu</i>, and <i>inteneb</i>, and <i>khasait</i>, and the incense that is
offered up in the temples, whereby every god is propitiated.
I will relate [unto him] the things that have happened unto
me, and declare the things that have been seen by me through
thy power, and praise and thanksgiving shall be made unto
thee in my city in the presence of all the nobles of the country.
I will slaughter bulls for thee, and will offer them up as burnt-offerings,
and I will pluck feathered fowl in thine [honour].
And I will cause to come to thee boats laden with all the most
costly products of the land of Egypt, even according to what
is done for a god who is beloved by men and women in a land
far away, whom they know not." Then the serpent smiled
at me, and the things which I had said to it were regarded
by it in its heart as nonsense, for it said unto me, "Thou
hast not a very great store of myrrh [in Egypt], and all that
thou hast is incense. Behold, I am the Prince of Punt, and
the myrrh which is therein belongeth to me. And as for
the <i>heken</i> which thou hast said thou wilt cause to be brought
to me, is it not one of the chief [products] of this island?
And behold, it shall come to pass that when thou hast once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_212" id="Pg_212" title="Pg_212">[212]</a></span>departed from this place, thou shalt never more see this island,
for it shall disappear into the waves."</p>

<p>And in due course, even as the serpent had predicted, a
ship arrived, and I climbed up to the top of a high tree, and
I recognised those who were in it. Then I went to announce
the matter to the serpent, but I found that it had knowledge
thereof already. And the serpent said unto me, "A safe
[journey], a safe [journey], O little one, to thy house. Thou
shalt see thy children [again]. I beseech thee that my name
may be held in fair repute in thy city, for verily this is the
thing which I desire of thee." Then I threw myself flat
upon my stomach, and my two hands were folded humbly
before the serpent. And the serpent gave me a [ship-] load
of things, namely, myrrh, <i>heken, inteneb, khasait, thsheps</i>
and <i>shaas</i> spices, eye-paint (antimony), skins of panthers,
great balls of incense, tusks of elephants, greyhounds, apes,
monkeys, and beautiful and costly products of all sorts and
kinds. And when I had loaded these things into the ship,
and had thrown myself flat upon my stomach in order to give
thanks unto it for the same, it spake unto me, saying, "Verily
thou shalt travel to [thy] country in two months, and thou
shalt fill both thy arms with thy children, and thou shalt
renew thy youth in thy coffin." Then I went down to the
place on the sea-shore where the ship was, and I hailed the
bowmen who were in the ship, and I spake words of thanksgiving
to the lord of this island, and those who were in the
ship did the same. Then we set sail, and we journeyed on
and returned to the country of the King, and we arrived there
at the end of two months, according to all that the serpent
had said. And I entered into the presence of the King, and
I took with me for him the offerings which I had brought out
of the island. And the King praised me and thanked me
in the presence of the nobles of all his country, and he appointed
me to be one of his bodyguard, and I received my
wages along with those who were his [regular] servants.</p>

<p>Cast thou thy glance then upon me [O Prince], now that
I have set my feet on my native land once more, having seen
and experienced what I have seen and experienced. Hearken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_213" id="Pg_213" title="Pg_213">[213]</a></span>thou unto me, for verily it is a good thing to hearken unto
men. And the Prince said unto me, "Make not thyself
out to be perfect, my friend! Doth a man give water to
a fowl at daybreak which he is going to kill during the day?"</p>

<h3>EGYPTIAN HYMNS TO THE GODS<br /><br /></h3>


<p>In this chapter are given translations of Hymns that were
sung in the temples in honour of the great gods of Egypt
between 1600 B.C. and 900 B.C., and of Hymns that were
used by kings and private individuals. The following <b>Hymn

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Here endeth * [the Hymn] in peace,* according
to an ancient copy.*</span><br /><br /></p>

<p>The following extract is taken from a work in which the
power and glory of Amen are described in a long series of
Chapters; the papyrus in which it is written is in Leyden.</p>

<p>"[He, <i>i.e.</i> Amen], driveth away evils and scattereth
diseases. He is the physician who healeth the eye without
[the use of] medicaments. He openeth the eyes, he driveth
away inflammation (?)... He delivereth whom he pleaseth,
even from the Tuat (the Other World). He saveth a man
from what is ordained for him at the dictates of his heart.
To him belong both eyes and ears, [he is] on every path of
him whom he loveth. He heareth the petitions of him that
appealeth to him. He cometh from afar to him that calleth
[before] a moment hath passed. He maketh high (<i>i.e.</i> long)
the life [of a man], he cutteth it short. To him whom he
loveth he giveth more than hath been fated for him. [When]
Amen casteth a spell on the water, and his name is on the
waters, if this name of his be uttered the crocodile (?) hath no
power. The winds are driven back, the hurricane is repulsed.
At the remembrance of him the wrath of the angry man dieth
down. He speaketh the gentle word at the moment of
strife. He is a pleasant breeze to him that appealeth to him.
He delivereth the helpless one. He is the wise (?) god whose
plans are beneficent.... He is more helpful than millions
to the man who hath set him in his heart. One warrior
[who fighteth] under his name is better than hundreds of
thousands. Indeed he is the beneficent strong one. He is
perfect [and] seizeth his moment; he is irresistible....
All the gods are three, Amen, R&#257; and Ptah, and there are none
like unto them. He whose name is hidden is Amen. R&#257;
belongeth to him as his face, and his body is Ptah. Their
cities are established upon the earth for ever, [namely,]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_220" id="Pg_220" title="Pg_220">[220]</a></span>Thebes, Anu (Heliopolis), and Hetkaptah (Memphis). When
a message is sent from heaven it is heard in Anu, and is repeated
in Memphis to the Beautiful Face (<i>i.e.</i> Ptah). It is
done into writing, in the letters of Thoth (<i>i.e.</i> hieroglyphs),
and despatched to the City of Amen (<i>i.e.</i> Thebes), with their
things. The matters are answered in Thebes.... His
heart is Understanding, his lips are Taste, his Ka is all the
things that are in his mouth. He entereth, the two caverns
are beneath his feet. The Nile appeareth from the hollow
beneath his sandals. His soul is Shu, his heart is Tefnut.
He is Heru-Khuti in the upper heaven. His right eye is
day. His left eye is night. He is the leader of faces on
every path. His body is Nu. The dweller in it is the Nile,
producing everything that is, nourishing all that is. He
breatheth breath into all nostrils. The Luck and the Destiny
of every man are with him. His wife is the earth, he uniteth
with her, his seed is the tree of life, his emanations are the
grain."<br /><br /></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hymns to the Sun-god</span></h3>

<p>The following extracts from Hymns to the Sun-god and
Osiris are written in the hieratic character upon slices of limestone
now preserved in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.</p>

<p>"Well dost thou watch, O Horus, who sailest over the
sky, thou child who proceedest from the divine father, thou
child of fire, who shinest like crystal, who destroyest the
darkness and the night. Thou child who growest rapidly,
with gracious form, who restest in thine eye. Thou wakest
up men who are asleep on their beds, and the reptiles in their
nests. Thy boat saileth on the fiery Lake Neserser, and thou
traversest the upper sky by means of the winds thereof.
The two daughters of the Nile-god crush for thee the fiend
Neka, Nubti (<i>i.e.</i> Set) pierceth him with his arrows. Keb
seizeth (?) him by the joint of his back, Serqet grippeth him
at his throat. The flame of this serpent that is over the door
of thy house burneth him up. The Great Company of the
Gods are wroth with him, and they rejoice because he is cut
to pieces. The Children of Horus grasp their knives, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_221" id="Pg_221" title="Pg_221">[221]</a></span>inflict very many gashes in him. Hail! Thine enemy hath
fallen, and Truth standeth firm before thee. When thou
again transformest thyself into Tem, thou givest thy hand to
the Lords of Akert (<i>i.e.</i> the dead), those who lie in death
give thanks for thy beauties when thy light falleth upon them.
They declare unto thee what is their hearts' wish, which is
that they may see thee again. When thou hast passed them
by, the darkness covereth them, each one in his coffin. Thou
art the lord of those who cry out (?) to thee, the god who is
beneficent for ever. Thou art the Judge of words and deeds,
the Chief of chief judges, who stablishest truth, and doest
away sin. May he who attacketh me be judged rightly,
behold, he is stronger than I am; he hath seized upon my
office, and hath carried it off with falsehood. May it be
restored to me."<br /><br /></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hymn to Osirus</span></h3>

<p>"[Praise be] unto thee, O thou who extendest thine arms,
who liest asleep on thy side, who liest on the sand, the Lord
of the earth, the divine mummy.... Thou art the Child
of the Earth Serpent, of great age. Thy head ... and goeth
round over thy feet. R&#257;-Khepera shineth upon thy body,
when thou liest on thy bed in the form of Seker, so that he
may drive away the darkness that shroudeth thee, and may
infuse light in thy two eyes. He passeth a long period of
time shining upon thee, and sheddeth tears over thee. The
earth resteth upon thy shoulders, and its corners rest upon
thee as far as the four pillars of heaven. If thou movest
thyself, the earth quaketh, for thou art greater than....
[The Nile] appeareth out of the sweat of thy two hands.
Thou breathest forth the air that is in thy throat into the
nostrils of men; divine is that thing whereon they live.
Through thy nostrils (?) subsist the flowers, the herbage,
the reeds, the flags (?), the barley, the wheat, and the plants
whereon men live. If canals are dug ... and houses and
temples are built, and great statues are dragged along, and
lands are ploughed up, and tombs and funerary monuments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_222" id="Pg_222" title="Pg_222">[222]</a></span>are made, they [all] rest upon thee. It is thou who makest
them. They are upon thy back. They are more than can
be done into writing (<i>i.e.</i> described). There is no vacant
space on thy back, they all lie on thy back, and yet [thou
sayest] not, "I am [over] weighted therewith. Thou art
the father and mother of men and women, they live by thy
breath, they eat the flesh of thy members. 'Pautti' (<i>i.e.</i>
Primeval God) is thy name." The writer of this hymn says
in the four broken lines that remain that he is unable to
understand the nature (?) of Osiris, which is hidden (?), and
his attributes, which are sublime.<br /><br /></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hymn to Shu</span></h3>

<p>The following Hymn is found in the Magical Papyrus
(Harris, No. 501), which is preserved in the British Museum.
The text is written in the hieratic character, and reads:</p>

<p>"Homage to thee, O flesh and bone of R&#257;, thou first-born
son who didst proceed from his members, who wast chosen
to be the chief of those who were brought forth, thou mighty
one, thou divine form, who art endowed with strength as
the lord of transformations. Thou overthrowest the Seba
fiends each day. The divine boat hath the wind [behind it],
thy heart is glad. Those who are in the &#256;ntti Boat utter
loud cries of joy when they see Shu, the son of R&#257;, triumphant,
[and] driving his spear into the serpent fiend Nekau.
R&#257; setteth out to sail over the heavens at dawn daily. The
goddess Tefnut is seated on thy head, she hurleth her flames
of fire against thy enemies, and maketh them to be destroyed
utterly. Thou art equipped by R&#257;, thou art mighty through
his words of power, thou art the heir of thy father upon his
throne, and thy Doubles rest in the Doubles of R&#257;, even as
the taste of what hath been in the mouth remaineth therein.
A will hath been done into writing by the lord of Khemenu
(Thoth), the scribe of the library of R&#257;-Harmakhis, in the
hall of the divine house (or temple) of Anu (Heliopolis),
stablished, perfected, and made permanent in hieroglyphs
under the feet of R&#257;-Harmakhis, and he shall transmit it to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_223" id="Pg_223" title="Pg_223">[223]</a></span>the son of his son for ever and ever. Homage to thee, O son
of R&#257;, who wast begotten by Temu himself. Thou didst
create thyself, and thou hadst no mother. Thou art Truth,
the lord of Truth, thou art the Power, the ruling power of the
gods. Thou dost conduct the Eye of thy father R&#257;. They
give gifts unto thee into thine own hands. Thou makest
to be at peace the Great Goddess, when storms are passing
over her. Thou dost stretch out the heavens on high, and
dost establish them with thine own hands. Every god boweth
in homage before thee, the King of the South, the King
of the North, Shu, the son of <span class="smcap">R&#257;</span>, life, strength and health
be to thee! Thou, O great god Pautti, art furnished with
the brilliance of the Eye [of R&#257;] in Heliopolis, to overthrow
the Seba fiends on behalf of thy father. Thou makest the
divine Boat to sail onwards in peace. The mariners who are
therein exult, and all the gods shout for joy when they hear
thy divine name. Greater, yea greater (<i>i.e.</i> twice great) art
thou than the gods in thy name of Shu, son of R&#257;."<br /></p>

<h3>MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL LITERATURE<br /><br /></h3>


<p>Side by side with the great mass of literature of a magical
and religious character that flourished in Egypt under the
Ancient Empire, we find that there existed also a class of
writings that are remarkably like those contained in the
Book of Proverbs, which is attributed to Solomon, the King of
Israel, and in "Ecclesiasticus," and the "Book of Wisdom."
The priests of Egypt took the greatest trouble to compose
Books of the Dead and Guides to the Other World in order to
help the souls of the dead to traverse in safety the region
that lay between this world and the next, or Dead Land,
and the high officials who flourished under the Pharaohs of
the early dynasties drew up works, the object of which was
to enable the living man to conduct himself in such a way
as to satisfy his social superiors, to please his equals, and to
content his inferiors, and at the same time to advance to
honours and wealth himself. These works represent the
experience, and shrewdness, and knowledge which their
writers had gained at the Court of the Pharaohs, and are
full of sound worldly wisdom and high moral excellence.
They were written to teach young men of the royal and
aristocratic classes to fear God, to honour the king, to do
their duty efficiently, to lead strictly moral, if not exactly
religious, lives, to treat every man with the respect due to
his position in life, to cultivate home life, and to do their
duty to their neighbours, both to those who were rich and
those who were poor. The oldest Egyptian book of <b>Moral
Precepts, or Maxims, or Admonitions</b>, is that of Ptah-hetep,
governor of the town of Memphis, and high confidential
adviser of the king; he flourished in the reign of Assa, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_225" id="Pg_225" title="Pg_225">[225]</a></span>king of the fifth dynasty, about 3500 B.C. His work is found,
more or less complete, in several papyri, which are preserved
in the British Museum and in the National Library in Paris,
and extracts from it, which were used by Egyptian pupils
in the schools attached to the temples, and which are written
upon slices of limestone, are to be seen in the Egyptian
Museum in Cairo and elsewhere. The oldest copy of the
work contains many mistakes, and in some places the text
is unintelligible, but many parts of it can be translated,
and the following extracts will illustrate the piety and moral
worth, and the sagacity and experience of the shrewd but
kindly "man of the world" who undertook to guide the
young prince of his day. The sage begins his work with a
lament about the evil effects that follow old age in a man&mdash;</p>

<p>"Depression seizeth upon him every day, his eyesight faileth,
his ears become deaf, his strength declineth, his heart hath
no rest, the mouth becometh silent and speaketh not, the
intelligence diminisheth, and it is impossible to remember
to-day what happened yesterday. The bones are full of
pain, the pursuit that was formerly attended with pleasure
is now fraught with pain, and the sense of taste departeth.
Old age is the worst of all the miseries that can befall a man.
The nose becometh stopped up and one cannot smell at all."
At this point Ptah-hetep asks, rhetorically, "Who will give
me authority to speak? Who is it that will authorise me
to repeat to the prince the Precepts of those who had knowledge
of the wise counsels of the learned men of old? "In
answer to these questions the king replies to Ptah-hetep,
"Instruct thou my son in the words of wisdom of olden time.
It is instruction of this kind alone that formeth the character
of the sons of noblemen, and the youth who hearkeneth to
such instruction will acquire a right understanding and the
faculty of judging justly, and he will not feel weary of his
duties." Immediately following these words come the
"Precepts of beautiful speech" of Ptah-hetep, whose full
titles are given, viz. the Erp&#257;, the Duke, the father of the
god <i>(i.e.</i> the king), the friend of God, the son of the king.
Governor of Memphis, confidential servant of the king.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_226" id="Pg_226" title="Pg_226">[226]</a></span>These Precepts instruct the ignorant, and teach them to
understand fine speech; among them are the following:</p>

<p>"Be not haughty because of thy knowledge. Converse
with the ignorant man as well as with him that is educated.</p>

<p>"Do not terrify the people, for if thou dost, God will
punish thee. If any man saith that he is going to live by
these means, God will make his mouth empty of food. If
a man saith that he is going to make himself powerful (or
rich) thereby, saying, 'I shall reap advantage, having knowledge,'
and if he saith, 'I will beat down the other man,' he
will arrive at the result of being able to do nothing. Let no
man terrify the people, for the command of God is that they
shall enjoy rest.</p>

<p>"If thou art one of a company seated to eat in the house
of a man who is greater than thyself, take what he giveth
thee [without remark]. Set it before thee. Look at what
is before thee, but not too closely, and do not look at it too
often. The man who rejecteth it is an ill-mannered person.
Do not speak to interrupt when he is speaking, for one knoweth
not when he may disapprove. Speak when he addresseth
thee, and then thy words shall be acceptable. When a man
hath wealth he ordereth his actions according to his own
dictates. He doeth what he willeth.... The great man
can effect by the mere lifting up of his hand what a [poor]
man cannot. Since the eating of bread is according to the
dispensation of God, a man cannot object thereto.</p>

<p>"If thou art a man whose duty it is to enter into the
presence of a nobleman with a message from another nobleman,
take care to say correctly and in the correct way what
thou art sent to say; give the message exactly as he said it.
Take great care not to spoil it in delivery and so to set one
nobleman against another. He who wresteth the truth in
transmitting the message, and only repeateth it in words that
give pleasure to all men, gentleman or common man, is an
abominable person.</p>

<p>"If thou art a farmer, till the field which the great God
hath given thee. Eat not too much when thou art near thy
neighbours.... The children of the man who, being a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_227" id="Pg_227" title="Pg_227">[227]</a></span>man of substance, seizeth [prey] like the crocodile in the
presence of the field labourers, are cursed because of his
behaviour, his father suffereth poignant grief, and as for the
mother who bore him, every other woman is happier than
she. A man who is the leader of a clan (or tribe) that trusteth
him and followeth him becometh a god.</p>

<p>"If thou dost humble thyself and dost obey a wise man,
thy behaviour will be held to be good before God. Since thou
knowest who are to serve, and who are to command, let
not thy heart magnify itself against the latter. Since thou
knowest who hath the power, hold in fear him that hath it....</p>

<p>"Be diligent at all times. Do more than is commanded.
Waste not the time wherein thou canst labour; he is an
abominable man who maketh a bad use of his time. Lose
no chance day by day in adding to the riches of thy house.
Work produceth wealth, and wealth endureth not when work
is abandoned.</p>

<p>"If thou art a wise man, beget a son who shall be pleasing
unto God.</p>

<p>"If thou art a wise man, be master of thy house. Love
thy wife absolutely, give her food in abundance, and raiment
for her back; these are the medicines for her body. Anoint
her with unguents, and make her happy as long as thou
livest. She is thy field, and she reflecteth credit on her
possessor. Be not harsh in thy house, for she will be more
easily moved by persuasion than by violence. Satisfy her
wish, observe what she expecteth, and take note of that
whereon she hath fixed her gaze. This is the treatment that
will keep her in her house; if thou repel her advances, it is
ruin for thee. Embrace her, call her by fond names, and
treat her lovingly.</p>

<p>"Treat thy dependants as well as thou art able, for this
is the duty of those whom God hath blessed.</p>

<p>"If thou art a wise man, and if thou hast a seat in the
council chamber of thy lord, concentrate thy mind on the
business [so as to arrive at] a wise decision. Keep silence,
for this is better than to talk overmuch. When thou speakest
thou must know what can be urged against thy words. To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_228" id="Pg_228" title="Pg_228">[228]</a></span>speak in the council chamber [needeth] skill and experience.</p>

<p>"If thou hast become a great man having once been a
poor man, and hast attained to the headship of the city,
study not to take the fullest advantage of thy situation.
Be not harsh in respect of the grain, for thou art only an
overseer of the food of God.</p>

<p>"Think much, but keep thy mouth closed; if thou dost
not how canst thou consult with the nobles? Let thy
opinion coincide with that of thy lord. Do what he saith,
and then he shall say of thee to those who are listening,
'This is my son.'"</p>

<p>The above and all the other Precepts of Ptah-hetep were
drawn up for the guidance of highly-placed young men,
and have little to do with practical, every-day morality.
But whilst the Egyptian scribes who lived under the Middle
and New Empires were ready to pay all honour to the writings
of an earlier age, they were not slow to perceive that
the older Precepts did not supply advice on every important
subject, and they therefore proceeded to write supplementary
Precepts. A very interesting collection of such Precepts is
found in a papyrus preserved in the Egyptian Museum,
Cairo. They are generally known as the "<b>Maxims of Ani</b>,"
and the following examples will illustrate their scope and
character:</p>

<p>"Celebrate thou the festival of thy God, and repeat the
celebration thereof in its appointed season. God is wroth
with the transgressor of this law. Bear testimony [to Him]
after thy offering....</p>

<p>"The opportunity having passed, one seeketh [in vain]
to seize another.</p>

<p>"God will magnify the name of the man who exalteth His
Souls, who singeth His praises, and boweth before Him, who
offereth incense, and doeth homage [to Him] in his work.</p>

<p>"Enter not into the presence of the drunkard, even if
his acquaintance be an honour to thee.</p>

<p>"Beware of the woman in the street who is not known in
her native town. Follow her not, nor any woman who is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_229" id="Pg_229" title="Pg_229">[229]</a></span>like her. Do not make her acquaintance. She is like a deep
stream the windings of which are unknown.</p>

<p>"Go not with common men, lest thy name be made to
stink."</p>

<p>"When an inquiry is held, and thou art present, multiply
not speech; thou wilt do better if thou holdest thy peace.
Act not the part of the chatterer.</p>

<p>"The sanctuary of God abhorreth noisy demonstrations.
Pray thou with a loving heart, and let thy words be hidden
(or secret). Do this, and He will do thy business for thee. He
will hearken unto thy words, and He will receive thy offering.</p>

<p>"Place water before thy father and thy mother who rest
in their tombs.... Forget not to do this when thou art
outside thy house, and as thou doest for them so shall thy son
do for thee."</p>

<p>"Frequent not the house where men drink beer, for the
words that fall from thy mouth will be repeated, and it is a
bad thing for thee not to know what thou didst really say.
Thou wilt fall down, thy bones may be broken, and there will
be no one to give thee a hand [to help thee]. Thy boon
companions who are drinking with thee will say, 'Throw this
drunken man out of the door.' When thy friends come to
look for thee, they will find thee lying on the ground as helpless
as a babe.</p>

<p>"When the messenger of [death] cometh to carry thee
away, let him find thee prepared. Alas, thou wilt have no
opportunity for speech, for verily his terror will be before
thee. Say not, 'Thou art carrying me off in my youth.'
Thou knowest not when thy death will take place. Death
cometh, and he seizeth the babe at the breast of his mother,
as well as the man who hath arrived at a ripe old age. Observe
this, for I speak unto thee good advice which thou
shalt meditate upon in thy heart. Do these things, and
thou wilt be a good man, and evils of all kinds shall remove
themselves from thee."</p>

<p>"Remain not seated whilst another is standing, especially
if he be an old man, even though thy social position (or rank)
be higher than his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_230" id="Pg_230" title="Pg_230">[230]</a></span>"The man who uttereth ill-natured words must not expect
to receive good-natured deeds.</p>

<p>"If thou journeyest on a road [made by] thy hands each
day, thou wilt arrive at the place where thou wouldst be.</p>

<p>"What ought people to talk about every day? Administrators
of high rank should discuss the laws, women should
talk about their husbands, and every man should speak about
his own affairs.</p>

<p>"Never speak an ill-natured word to any visitor; a word
dropped some day when thou art gossiping may overturn
thy house.</p>

<p>"If thou art well-versed in books, and hast gone into them,
set them in thy heart; whatsoever thou then utterest will
be good. If the scribe be appointed to any position, he will
converse about his documents. The director of the treasury
hath no son, and the overseer of the seal hath no heir. High
officials esteem the scribe, whose hand is his position of
honour, which they do not give to children....</p>

<p>"The ruin of a man resteth on his tongue; take heed that
thou harmest not thyself.</p>

<p>"The heart of a man is [like] the store-chamber of a granary
that is full of answers of every kind; choose thou those
that are good, and utter them, and keep those that are bad
closely confined within thee. To answer roughly is like the
brandishing of weapons, but if thou wilt speak kindly and
quietly thou wilt always [be loved].</p>

<p>"When thou offerest up offerings to thy God, beware lest
thou offer the things that are an abomination [to Him].
Chatter not [during] his journeyings (or processions), seek
not to prolong (?) his appearance, disturb not those who carry
him, chant not his offices too loudly, and beware lest thou....
Let thine eye observe his dispensations. Devote thyself
to the adoration of his name. It is he who giveth souls to
millions of forms, and he magnifieth the man who magnifieth
him....</p>

<p>"I gave thee thy mother who bore thee, and in bearing
thee she took upon herself a great burden, which she bore
without help from me. When after some months thou wast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_231" id="Pg_231" title="Pg_231">[231]</a></span>born, she placed herself under a yoke, for three years she
suckled thee.... When thou wast sent to school to be
educated, she brought bread and beer for thee from her house
to thy master regularly each day. Thou art now grown up,
and thou hast a wife and a house of thy own. Keep thine
eye on thy child, and bring him up as thy mother brought
thee up. Do nothing whatsoever that will cause her (<i>i.e.</i>
thy mother) to suffer, lest she lift up her hands to God, and
He hear her complaint, [and punish thee].</p>

<p>"Eat not bread, whilst another standeth by, without
pointing out to him the bread with thy hand....</p>

<p>"Devote thyself to God, take heed to thyself daily for the
sake of God, and let to-morrow be as to-day. Work thou
[for him]. God seeth him that worketh for Him, and He
esteemeth lightly the man who esteemeth Him lightly.</p>

<p>"Follow not after a woman, and let her not take possession
of thy heart.</p>

<p>"Answer not a man when he is wroth, but remove thyself
from him. Speak gently to him that hath spoken in anger,
for soft words are the medicine for his heart.</p>

<p>"Seek silence for thyself."<br /></p>


<p>For the study of the moral character of the ancient Egyptian,
a document, of which a mutilated copy is found on a
papyrus preserved in the Royal Library in Berlin, is of
peculiar importance. As the opening lines are wanting it
is impossible to know what the title of the work was, but
because the text records a conversation that took place
between a man who had suffered grievous misfortunes, and
was weary of the world and of all in it, and wished to kill
himself, it is generally called the "<span class="smcap"><b>Talk of a man who was
tired of life with his soul</b></span>." The general meaning of the
document is clear. The man weary of life discusses with
his soul, as if it were a being wholly distinct from himself,
whether he shall kill himself or not. He is willing to do so,
but is only kept from his purpose by his soul's observation
that if he does there will be no one to bury him properly,
and to see that the funerary ceremonies are duly performed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_232" id="Pg_232" title="Pg_232">[232]</a></span>This shows that the man who was tired of life was alone in
the world, and that all his relations and friends had either
forsaken him, or had been driven away by him. His soul
then advised him to destroy himself by means of fire, probably,
as has been suggested, because the ashes of a burnt
body would need no further care. The man accepted the
advice of his soul, and was about to follow it literally, when
the soul itself drew back, being afraid to undergo the sufferings
inherent in such a death for the body. The man then
asked his soul to perform for him the last rites, but it absolutely
refused to do so, and told him that it objected to death
in any form, and that it had no desire at all to depart to the
kingdom of the dead. The soul supports its objection to
suffer by telling the man who is tired of life that the mere
remembrance of burial is fraught with mourning, and tears,
and sorrow. It means that a man is torn away from his
house and thrown out upon a hill, and that he will never go
up again to see the sun. And after all, what is the good of
burial? Take the case of those who have had granite tombs,
and funerary monuments in the form of pyramids made for
them, and who lie in them in great state and dignity. If we
look at the slabs in their tombs, which have been placed there
on purpose to receive offerings from the kinsfolk and friends
of the deceased, we shall find that they are just as bare as
are the tablets for offerings of the wretched people who
belong to the Corv&eacute;e, of whom some die on the banks of the
canals, leaving one part of their bodies on the land and the
other in the water, and some fall into the water altogether
and are eaten by the fish, and others under the burning heat
of the sun become bloated and loathsome objects. Because
men receive fine burials it does not follow that offerings of
food, which will enable them to continue their existence,
will be made by their kinsfolk. Finally the soul ends its
speech with the advice that represented the view of the
average Egyptian in all ages, "Follow after the day of happiness,
and banish care," that is to say, spare no pains in
making thyself happy at all times, and let nothing that concerns
the present or the future trouble thee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_233" id="Pg_233" title="Pg_233">[233]</a></span>This advice, which is well expressed by the words which the
rich man spake to his soul, "Take thine ease, eat, drink, and
be merry" (St. Luke xii. 19), was not acceptable to the man
who was tired of life, and he at once addressed to his soul a
series of remarks, couched in rhythmical language, in which
he made it clear that, so far as he was concerned, death would
be preferable to life. He begins by saying that his name
is more detested than the smell of birds on a summer's day
when the heavens are hot, and the smell of a handler of fish
newly caught when the heavens are hot, and the smell of
water-fowl in a bed of willows wherein geese collect, and the
smell of fishermen in the marshes where fishing hath been
carried on, and the stench of crocodiles, and the place where
crocodiles do congregate. In a second group of rhythmical
passages the man who was tired of life goes on to describe
the unsatisfactory and corrupt condition of society, and his
wholesale condemnation of it includes his own kinsfolk.
Each passage begins with the words, "Unto whom do I
speak this day?" and he says, "Brothers are bad, and the
friends of to-day lack love. Hearts are shameless, and every
man seizeth the goods of his neighbour. The meek man goeth
to ground (<i>i.e.</i> is destroyed), and the audacious man maketh
his way into all places. The man of gracious countenance
is wretched, and the good are everywhere treated as contemptible.
When a man stirreth thee up to wrath by his
wickedness, his evil acts make all people laugh. One robbeth,
and everyone stealeth the possessions of his neighbour.
Disease is continual, and the brother who is with it becometh
an enemy. One remembereth not yesterday, and one doeth
nothing ... in this hour. Brothers are bad.... Faces
disappear, and each hath a worse aspect than that of his
brother. Hearts are shameless, and the man upon whom
one leaneth hath no heart. There are no righteous men
left, the earth is an example of those who do evil. There
is no true man left, and each is ignorant of what he
hath learnt. No man is content with what he hath; go
with the man [you believe to be contented], and he is not
[to be found]. I am heavily laden with misery, and I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_234" id="Pg_234" title="Pg_234">[234]</a></span>no true friend. Evil hath smitten the land, and there is no
end to it."</p>

<p>The state of the world being thus, the man who was tired
of life is driven to think that there is nothing left for him but
death; it is hopeless to expect the whole state of society
to change for the better, therefore death must be his deliverer.
To his soul he says, "Death standeth before me this day,
[and is to me as] the restoration to health of a man who hath
been sick, and as the coming out into the fresh air after sickness.
Death standeth before me this day like the smell of
myrrh, and the sitting under the sail of a boat on a day with
a fresh breeze. Death standeth before me this day like the
smell of lotus flowers, and like one who is sitting on the bank
of drunkenness.<a name="FNanchor_1_168" id="FNanchor_1_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_168" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Death standeth before me this day like
a brook filled with rain water, and like the return of a man
to his own house from the ship of war. Death standeth before
me this day like the brightening of the sky after a storm,
and like one.... Death standeth before me this day as a
man who wisheth to see his home once again, having passed
many years as a prisoner." The three rhythmical passages
that follow show that the man who was tired of life looked
beyond death to a happier state of existence, in which wrong
would be righted, and he who had suffered on this earth
would be abundantly rewarded. The place where justice
reigned supreme was ruled over by R&#257;, and the man does not
call it "heaven," but merely "there."<a name="FNanchor_2_169" id="FNanchor_2_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_169" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He says, "He who
is there shall indeed be like unto a loving god, and he shall
punish him that doeth wickedness. He who is there shall
certainly stand in the Boat of the Sun, and shall bestow upon
the temples the best [offerings]. He who is there shall indeed
become a man of understanding who cannot be resisted,
and who prayeth to R&#257; when he speaketh." The arguments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_235" id="Pg_235" title="Pg_235">[235]</a></span>in favour of death of the man who was tired of life are superior
to those of the soul in favour of life, for he saw beyond death
the "there" which the soul apparently had not sufficiently
considered. The value of the discussion between the man
and his soul was great in the opinion of the ancient Egyptian
because it showed, with almost logical emphasis, that the
incomprehensible things of "here" would be made clear
"there."</p>

<p>The man who was tired of life did not stand alone in his
discontent with the surroundings in which he lived, and with
his fellow-man, for from a board inscribed in hieratic in the
British Museum (No. 5645) we find that a priest of Heliopolis
called <b>Khakhepersenb, who was surnamed &#256;nkhu</b>, shared
his discontent, and was filled with disgust at the widespread
corruption and decadence of all classes of society that were
everywhere in the land. In the introduction to this description
of society as he saw it, he says that he wishes he possessed
new language in which to express himself, and that he could
find phrases that were not trite in which to utter his experience.
He says that men of one generation are very much
like those of another, and have all done and said the same
kind of things. He wishes to unburden his mind, and to
remove his moral sickness by stating what he has to say in
words that have not before been used. He then goes on to
say, "I ponder on the things that have taken place, and the
events that have occurred throughout the land. Things
have happened, and they are different from those of last
year. Each year is more wearisome than the last. The
whole country is disturbed and is going to destruction.
Justice (or right) is thrust out, injustice (or sin) is in the
council hall, the plans of the gods are upset, and their behests
are set aside. The country is in a miserable state, grief is
in every place, and both towns and provinces lament. Every
one is suffering through wrong-doing. All respect of persons
is banished. The lords of quiet are set in commotion. When
daylight cometh each day [every] face turneth away from
the sight of what hath happened [during the night]....
I ponder on the things that have taken place. Troubles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_236" id="Pg_236" title="Pg_236">[236]</a></span>flow in to-day, and to-morrow [tribulations] will not cease.
Though all the country is full of unrest, none will speak about
it. There is no innocent man [left], every one worketh
wickedness. Hearts are bowed in grief. He who giveth
orders is like unto the man to whom orders are given, and
their hearts are well pleased. Men wake daily [and find it
so], yet they do not abate it. The things of yesterday are
like those of to-day, and in many respects both days are alike.
Men's faces are stupid, and there is none capable of understanding,
and none is driven to speak by his anger....
My pain is keen and protracted. The poor man hath not
the strength to protect himself against the man who is
stronger than he. To hold the tongue about what one
heareth is agony, but to reply to the man who doth not
understand causeth suffering. If one protesteth against
what is said, the result is hatred; for the truth is not understood,
and every protest is resented. The only words which
any man will now listen to are his own. Every one believes
in his own.... Truth hath forsaken speech altogether."</p>

<p>Whether the copy of the work from which the above extracts
is taken be complete or not cannot be said, but in any
case there is no suggestion on the board in the British
Museum that the author of the work had any remedy in his
mind for the lamentable state of things which he describes.
Another Egyptian writer, called <b>Apuur</b>, who probably
flourished a little before the rule of the kings of the twelfth
dynasty, depicts the terrible state of misery and corruption
into which Egypt had fallen in his time, but his despair is
not so deep as that of the man who was tired of his life or
that of the priest Khakhepersenb. On the contrary, he has
sufficient hope of his country to believe that the day will
come when society shall be reformed, and when wickedness
and corruption shall be done away, and when the land shall
be ruled by a just ruler. It is difficult to say, but it seems
as if he thought this ruler would be a king who would govern
Egypt with righteousness, as did R&#257; in the remote ages,
and that his advent was not far off. The Papyrus in which
the text on which these observations are based is preserved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_237" id="Pg_237" title="Pg_237">[237]</a></span>in Leyden, No. 1344. It has been discussed carefully by
several scholars, some of whom believe that its contents
prove that the expectation of the coming of a Messiah was
current in Egypt some forty-five centuries ago. The following
extracts will give an idea of the character of the indictment
which Apuur drew up against the Government and
society of his day, and which he had the temerity to proclaim
in the presence of the reigning king and his court. He says:
"The guardians of houses say, 'Let us go and steal.' The
snarers of birds have formed themselves into armed bands.
The peasants of the Delta have provided themselves with
bucklers. A man regardeth his son as his enemy. The
righteous man grieveth because of what hath taken place in
the country. A man goeth out with his shield to plough.
The man with a bow is ready [to shoot], the wrongdoer is
in every place. The inundation of the Nile cometh, yet no
one goeth out to plough. Poor men have gotten costly goods,
and the man who was unable to make his own sandals is a
possessor of wealth. The hearts of slaves are sad, and the
nobles no longer participate in the rejoicings of their people.
Men's hearts are violent, there is plague everywhere, blood
is in every place, death is common, and the mummy wrappings
call to people before they are used. Multitudes
are buried in the river, the stream is a tomb, and the place
of mummification is a canal. The gentle folk weep, the simple
folk are glad, and the people of every town say, 'Come, let
us blot out these who have power and possessions among
us.' Men resemble the mud-birds, filth is everywhere,
and every one is clad in dirty garments. The land spinneth
round like the wheel of the potter. The robber is a rich
man, and [the rich man] is a robber. The poor man groaneth
and saith, 'This is calamity indeed, but what can I do?'
The river is blood, and men drink it; they cease to be men
who thirst for water. Gates and their buildings are consumed
with fire, yet the palace is stable and nourishing. The boats
of the peoples of the South have failed to arrive, the towns
are destroyed, and Upper Egypt is desert. The crocodiles
are sated with their prey, for men willingly go to them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_238" id="Pg_238" title="Pg_238">[238]</a></span>The desert hath covered the land, the Nomes are destroyed,
and there are foreign troops in Egypt. People come hither
[from everywhere], there are no Egyptians left in the land.
On the necks of the women slaves [hang ornaments of] gold,
lapis-lazuli, silver, turquoise, carnelian, bronze, and <i>abhet</i>
stone. There is good food everywhere, and yet mistresses
of houses say, 'Would that we had something to eat.' The
skilled masons who build pyramids have become hinds on
farms, and those who tended the Boat of the god are yoked
together [in ploughing]. Men do not go on voyages to
Kepuna (Byblos in Syria) to-day. What shall we do for
cedar wood for our mummies, in coffins of which priests are
buried, and with the oil of which men are embalmed? They
come no longer. There is no gold, the handicrafts languish.
What is the good of a treasury if we have nothing to put in
it? Everything is in ruins. Laughter is dead, no one can
laugh. Groaning and lamentation are everywhere in the
land. Egyptians have turned into foreigners. The hair
hath fallen out of the head of every man. A gentleman
cannot be distinguished from a nobody. Every man saith,
'I would that I were dead,' and children say, '[My father]
ought not to have begotten me.' Children of princes are
dashed against the walls, the children of desire are cast out
into the desert, and Khnemu<a name="FNanchor_1_170" id="FNanchor_1_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_170" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> groaneth in sheer exhaustion.
The Asiatics have become workmen in the Delta. Noble
ladies and slave girls suffer alike. The women who used to
sing songs now sing dirges. Female slaves speak as they
like, and when their mistress commandeth they are aggrieved.
Princes go hungry and weep. The hasty man saith, 'If
I only knew where God was I would make offerings to Him.'
The hearts of the flocks weep, and the cattle groan because
of the condition of the land. A man striketh his own brother.
What is to be done? The roads are watched by robbers,
who hide in the bushes until a benighted traveller cometh,
when they rob him. They seize his goods, and beat him to
death with cudgels. Would that the human race might
perish, and there be no more conceiving or bringing to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_239" id="Pg_239" title="Pg_239">[239]</a></span>birth! If only the earth could be quiet, and revolts cease!
Men eat herbs and drink water, and there is no food for the
birds, and even the swill is taken from the mouths of the
swine. There is no grain anywhere, and people lack clothes,
unguents, and oil. Every man saith, 'There is none.' The
storehouse is destroyed, and its keeper lieth prone on the
ground. The documents have been filched from their
august chambers, and the shrine is desecrated. Words of
power are unravelled, and spells made powerless. The
public offices are broken open and their documents stolen,
and serfs have become their own masters. The laws of the
court-house are rejected, men trample on them in public,
and the poor break them in the street. Things are now done
that have never been done before, for a party of miserable
men have removed the king. The secrets of the Kings of
the South and of the North have been revealed. The man
who could not make a coffin for himself hath a large tomb.
The occupants of tombs have been cast out into the desert,
and the man who could not make a coffin for himself hath
now a treasury. He who could not build a hut for himself
is now master of a habitation with walls. The rich man
spendeth his night athirst, and he who begged for the leavings
in the pots hath now brimming bowls. Men who had fine
raiment are now in rags, and he who never wore a garment
at all now dresseth in fine linen. The poor have become
rich, and the rich poor. Noble ladies sell their children for
beds. Those who once had beds now sleep on the ground.
Noble ladies go hungry, whilst butchers are sated with what
was once prepared for them. A man is slain by his brother's
side, and that brother fleeth to save his own life."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_170" id="Footnote_1_170"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_170"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The god who fashioned the bodies of men.</p></div>

<p>Apuur next, in a series of five short exhortations, entreats
his bearers to take action of some sort; each exhortation
begins with the words, "Destroy the enemies of the sacred
palace (or Court)." These are followed by a series of sentences,
each of which begins with the word "Remember,"
and contains one exhortation to his hearers to perform certain
duties in connection with the service of the gods. Thus
they are told to burn incense and to pour out libations each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_240" id="Pg_240" title="Pg_240">[240]</a></span>morning, to offer various kinds of geese to the gods, to eat
natron, to make white bread, to set up poles on the temples
and stel&aelig; inside them, to make the priest to purify the
temples, to remove from his office the priest who is unclean,
&amp;c. After many breaks in the text we come to the passage
in which Apuur seems to foretell the coming of the king who
is to restore order and prosperity to the land. He is to make
cool that which is hot. He is to be the "shepherd of mankind,"
having no evil in his heart. When his herds are few
[and scattered], he will devote his time to bringing them
together, their hearts being inflamed. The passage continues,
"Would that he had perceived their nature in the
first generation (of men), then he would have repressed evils,
he would have stretched forth (his) arm against it, he would
have destroyed their seed (?) and their inheritance....
A fighter (?) goeth forth, that (he?) may destroy the wrongs
that (?) have been wrought. There is no pilot (?) in their
moment. Where is he (?) to-day? Is he sleeping? Behold,
his might is not seen." <a name="FNanchor_1_171" id="FNanchor_1_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_171" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Many of the passages in the
indictment of Apuur resemble the descriptions of the state
of the land of Israel and her people which are found in the
writings of the Hebrew Prophets, and the "shepherd of
mankind," <i>i.e.</i> of the Egyptians, forcibly reminds us of the
appeal to the "Shepherd of Israel" in Psalm lxxx. 1.</p>

<h3>EGYPTIAN POETICAL COMPOSITIONS<br /><br /></h3>


<p>The poetry of the Egyptians is wholly unlike that of western
nations, but closely resembles the rhythmical compositions
of the Hebrews, with their parallelism of members, with
which we are all familiar in the Book of Psalms, the Song of
Solomon, &amp;c. The most important collection of Egyptian
Songs known to us is contained in the famous papyrus in
the British Museum, No. 10,060, more commonly known as
"Harris 500." This papyrus was probably written in the
thirteenth century B.C., but many of the songs belong to a
far earlier date. Though dealing with a variety of subjects,
there is no doubt that all of them must be classed under the
heading of "Love Songs." In them the lover compares the
lady of his choice to many beautiful flowers and plants, and
describes at considerable length the pain and grief which her
absence causes him. The lines of the strophes are short,
and the construction is simple, and it seems certain that the
words owed their effect chiefly to the voice of the singer,
who then, as now, employed many semitones and thirds of
tones, and to the skill with which he played the accompaniment
on his harp. A papyrus at Leyden, which was written a
little later than the "Love Songs," contains three very curious
compositions. The first is a sort of lament of a pomegranate
tree, which, in spite of the service which it has rendered to
the "sister and her brother," is not included among trees
of the first class. In the second a fig tree expresses its gratitude
and its readiness to do the will of its mistress, and to
allow its branches to be cut off to make a bed for her. In
the third a sycamore tree invites the lady of the land on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_242" id="Pg_242" title="Pg_242">[242]</a></span>which it stands to come under the shadow of its branches,
and to enjoy a happy time with her lover, and promises
her that it will never speak about what it sees.</p>

<p>More interesting than any of the above songs is the so-called
"Song of the Harper," of which two copies are known:
the first is found in the papyrus Harris 500, already mentioned,
and the second in a papyrus at Leyden. Extracts
of this poem are also found on the walls of the tomb of Nefer-hetep
at Thebes. The copy in the papyrus reads:</p>


<p><span class="smcap"><b>The Poem that is in the hall of the tomb of [the King
of the South, the King of the North], Antuf</b>,<a name="FNanchor_1_172" id="FNanchor_1_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_172" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
whose word is truth, [and is cut] in front of the
Harper.</span></p>

<p>
O good prince, it is a decree,<br />
And what hath been ordained thereby is well,<br />
That the bodies of men shall pass away and disappear,<br />
Whilst others remain.<br />
<br />
Since the time of the oldest ancestors,<br />
The gods who lived in olden time,<br />
Who lie at rest in their sepulchres,<br />
The Masters and also the Shining Ones,<br />
Who have been buried in their splendid tombs,<br />
Who have built sacrificial halls in their tombs,<br />
Their place is no more.<br />
Consider what hath become of them!<br />
<br />
I have heard the words of Imhetep <a name="FNanchor_2_173" id="FNanchor_2_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_173" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and Herutataf,<a name="FNanchor_3_174" id="FNanchor_3_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_174" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><br />
Which are treasured above everything because they uttered them.<br />
Consider what hath become of their tombs!<br />
Their walls have been thrown down;<br />
Their places are no more;<br />
They are just as if they had never existed.<br />
<br />
Not one [of them] cometh from where they are.<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_243" id="Pg_243" title="Pg_243">[243]</a></span>

Who can describe to us their form (or, condition),<br />
Who can describe to us their surroundings,<br />
Who can give comfort to our hearts,<br />
And can act as our guide<br />
To the place whereunto they have departed?<br />
<br />
Give comfort to thy heart,<br />
And let thy heart forget these things;<br />
What is best for thee to do is<br />
To follow thy heart's desire as long as thou livest.<br />
<br />
Anoint thy head with scented unguents.<br />
Let thine apparel be of byssus<br />
Dipped in costly [perfumes],<br />
In the veritable products (?) of the gods.<br />
<br />
Enjoy thyself more than thou hast ever done before,<br />
And let not thy heart pine for lack of pleasure.<br />
<br />
Pursue thy heart's desire and thine own happiness.<br />
Order thy surroundings on earth in such a way<br />
That they may minister to the desire of thy heart;<br />
[For] at length that day of lamentation shall come,<br />
Wherein he whose heart is still shall not hear the lamentation.<br />
Never shall cries of grief cause<br />
To beat [again] the heart of a man who is in the grave.<br />
<br />
Therefore occupy thyself with thy pleasure daily,<br />
And never cease to enjoy thyself.<br />
<br />
Behold, a man is not permitted<br />
To carry his possessions away with him.<br />
Behold, there never was any one who, having departed,<br />
Was able to come back again.<br />

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS LITERATURE<br /><br /></h3>


<p>In this chapter are given short notices of a series of works
which the limits of this book make it impossible to describe
at greater length.<br /><br /></p>

<p><b>I.</b> The <span class="smcap"><b>Book of the Two Ways</b></span>.&mdash;This is a very ancient
funerary work, which is found written in cursive hieroglyphs
upon coffins of the eleventh and twelfth dynasties, of which
many fine examples are to be seen in the British Museum.
The object of the work is to provide the souls of the dead
with a guide that will enable them, when they leave this
world, to make a successful journey across the Tuat, <i>i.e.</i> the
Other World or Dead Land, to the region where Osiris lived
and ruled over the blessed dead. The work describes the
roads that must be travelled over, and names the places
where opposition is to be expected, and supplies the deceased
with the words of power which he is to utter when in difficulties.
The abode of the blessed dead could be reached
either by water or by land, and the book affords the information
necessary for journeying thither by either route. The
sections of the book are often accompanied by coloured
vignettes, which illustrate them, and serve as maps of the
various regions of the Other World, and describe the exact
positions of the streams and canals that have to be crossed,
and the Islands of the Blest, and the awful country of blazing
fire and boiling water in which the bodies, souls, and
spirits of the wicked were destroyed.<br /><br /></p>

<p><b>II.</b> The <span class="smcap"><b>Book "Am Tuat,"</b></span> or Guide to him that is in the
Tuat.&mdash;This Book has much in common with the Book of
the Two Ways. According to it, the region that lay between
this world and the realm of Osiris was divided into ten parts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_245" id="Pg_245" title="Pg_245">[245]</a></span>which were traversed, once each night, by the Sun-god in
the form which he took during the night. At the western
end was a sort of vestibule, through which the god passed
from the day sky into the Tuat, and at the eastern end was
another vestibule, through which he passed on leaving the
Tuat to re-enter the day sky. The two vestibules were
places of gloom and semi-darkness, and the ten divisions
of the Tuat were covered by black night. When the Sun-god
set in the west in the evening he was obliged to travel
through the Tuat to the eastern sky, in order to rise again
on this earth on the following day. He entered the Tuat
at or near Thebes, proceeded northwards, through the under-worlds
of Thebes, Abydos, Herakleopolis, Memphis, and Sa&#299;s,
then turned towards the east and crossed the Delta, and,
having passed through the underworld of Heliopolis,
appeared in the eastern sky to resume his daily course from
east to west. His journey so far as Memphis he made in a
boat, which sailed on the river of the Tuat. At Memphis
he left the boat on the river, and entered a magical boat
formed of a serpent's body, and so passed under the mountainous
district round about Sakk&#257;rah. At or near Sa&#299;s he
returned to his river boat, and sailing over the great marine
lakes of the Delta reached Heliopolis. The sun-god was
guided through each section of the Tuat by a goddess who
belonged to the district, and for the sake of uniformity the
journey through each section was supposed to occupy an
hour; the guiding goddess left the god's boat at the end of
her hour, and the goddess of the next section took her place.
The path of the god was lighted by fire, which the beings
who lived in the various sections poured out of their mouths,
and the attendant gods who were with them in his boat spake
words of power, which overcame all opposition and removed
every obstacle. As he passed through each section it was
temporarily lighted up by the fire already mentioned, and
he uttered words of power, the effect of which was to supply
the inhabitants of the section with air, food, and drink,
sufficient to last until the next night, when he would renew
the supply. Many parts of the Tuat were filled with hideous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_246" id="Pg_246" title="Pg_246">[246]</a></span>monsters in human and animal forms, and with evil spirits
of every kind, but they were all rendered powerless by the
spells uttered by the gods who were in attendance on the
Sun-god in his boat. At one time in the history of Egypt
it became the earnest wish of every pious man to make the
journey from this world to the next in the Boat of the Sun.
Armed with words of power and amulets of all kinds, and
relying on their lives of moral rectitude, and the effect of the
offerings which they had made to the dead, their souls entered
the Boat, and set out on their journey. When they reached
Abydos their credentials were examined, and those who
were found to be speakers of the truth and upright in their
actions were allowed to continue their journey with the Sun-god,
and to live with him ever after. Some souls preferred
to remain at Abydos and to live with Osiris, and those who
were found righteous in the Judgment were allowed to do
so, and were granted estates in perpetuity in the kingdom
of this god. The Book "<span class="smcap">Am Tuat</span>" describes the sections
of the Tuat and their inhabitants, and supplies all the information
which the soul was supposed to require in passing
from this world to the next. Many copies of certain sections
of it are known, and some of these are in the British
Museum;<a name="FNanchor_1_175" id="FNanchor_1_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_175" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the most complete copy of it is in the tomb of
Seti I at Thebes.</p>

Southern Egyptian Gallery of the British Museum.</p><br /></div>

<p><b>III.</b> The <span class="smcap"><b>Book of Gates</b></span>.&mdash;This book was also written to
be a Guide to the Tuat, and has much in common with the
Book of the Two Ways and with the Book Am Tuat. In
it also the Tuat is divided into ten sections and has two
vestibules, the Eastern and the Western, but at the entrance
to each section is a strongly fortified Gate, guarded by a
monster serpent-god and by the gods of the section. The
Sun-god of night, as in the Book Am Tuat, makes his journey
in a boat, and is attended by a number of gods, who remove
all opposition from his path by the use of words of power.
As he approaches each Gate, its doors are thrown open by
the gods who guard them, and he passes into the section of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_247" id="Pg_247" title="Pg_247">[247]</a></span>the Tuat behind it, carrying with him light, air, and food
for its inhabitants. The Book of Gates embodies the teaching
of the priests of the cult of Osiris, and the Book Am Tuat
represents the modified form of it that was promulgated
by the priests of Amen. From the Book of Gates we derive
much information about the realm of Osiris, and the Great
Judgment of souls, which took place in his Hall of Judgment
once a day at midnight. Then all the souls that had collected
during the past twenty-four hours from all parts of Egypt
were weighed in the Balance; the righteous were allotted
estates in perpetuity in the "land of souls," and the wicked
were destroyed by Shesmu, the executioner of the god, and
by his assistants. The texts that describe the various
"Gates" of the Book of Gates, explain who are the beings
represented in the pictures, and state why they were there.
And the Book proves conclusively that the Egyptians believed
in the efficacy of sacrifices and offerings, and in the
doctrine of righteous retribution; liars and deceivers were
condemned, and their bodies, souls, spirits, doubles, and
names destroyed, and the righteous were rewarded for their
upright lives and integrity upon earth by the gift of everlasting
life and happiness. The most complete copy of
this interesting work in England is cut on the alabaster
sarcophagus of Seti I, about 1350 B.C. This unique sepulchral
monument is exhibited gratis in Sir John Soane's
Museum at 13 Lincoln's Inn Fields, and every student of
the religion of the Egyptians should examine it.<br /><br /></p>

<p><b>IV.</b> The <span class="smcap"><b>Ritual of Embalmment</b></span>.&mdash;Two important fragments
of a copy of this work are preserved in the Museum
of the Louvre (No. 5158), and a part of another in the Egyptian
Museum, Cairo (No. 3); the former copy was written
for a priest of Amen called Heru, and the latter for a priest
called Hetra. These fragments of the work describe minutely
the process of mummifying certain parts of a human body,
and state what materials were employed by the embalmer.
Moreover, it gives the texts of the magical and religious
spells that were ordered to be recited by the priest who superintended
the embalmment, the effect of which was to "make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_248" id="Pg_248" title="Pg_248">[248]</a></span>divine" each member of the body, and to secure for it the
protecting influence of the god or goddess who presided over
it. The following extract refers to the embalming of the
head: "Then anoint the head of the deceased and all his
mouth with oil, both the head and the face, and wrap it in
the bandages of Harmakhis in Hebit. The bandage of the
goddess Nekhebet shall be put on the forehead, the bandage
of Hathor in Heliopolis on the face, the bandage of Thoth
on the ears, and the bandage of Nebt-hetepet on the back
of the neck. All the coverings of the head and all the strips
of linen used in fastening them shall be taken from sheets
of linen that have been examined as to quality and texture
in the presence of the inspector of the mysteries. On the
head of the deceased shall be the bandage of Sekhmet, beloved
of Ptah, in two pieces. On the two ears two bandages
called the "Complete." On the nostrils two bandages
called "Nehai" and "Smen." On the cheeks two bandages
called "He shall live." On the forehead four pieces of linen
called the "shining ones." On the skull two pieces called
"The two Eyes of R&#257; in their fullness." On the two sides
of the face and ears twenty-two pieces. As to the mouth
two inside, and two out. On the chin two pieces. On the
back of the neck four large pieces. Then tie the whole head
firmly with a strip of linen two fingers wide, and anoint a
second time, and then fill up all the crevices with the oil
already mentioned. Then say, "O august goddess, Lady
of the East, Mistress of the West, come and enter into the
two ears of Osiris. O mighty goddess, who art ever young,
O great one, Lady of the East, Mistress of the West, let there
be breathing in the head of the deceased in the Tuat. Let
him see with his eyes, hear with his ears, breathe with his
nose, pronounce with his mouth, and speak with his tongue
in the Tuat. Accept his voice in the Hall of Truth, and let
him be proved to have been a speaker of the truth in the
Hall of Keb, in the presence of the Great God, the Lord of
Amenti."<br /><br /></p>

<p><b>V.</b> The <span class="smcap"><b>Ritual of the Divine Cult</b></span>.&mdash;This title is commonly
given to a work consisting of sixty-six chapters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_249" id="Pg_249" title="Pg_249">[249]</a></span>which were recited daily by the high priest of Amen-R&#257;,
the King of the Gods, in his temple at Thebes, during the
performance of a series of ceremonies of a highly important
and symbolical character. The text of this Ritual is found
cut in hieroglyphs on the walls of the temple of Seti I at
Abydos, and written in hieratic upon papyri preserved in
the Imperial Museum in Berlin. The work was originally
intended to be recited by the king himself daily, but it was
soon found that the Lord of Egypt could not spare the time
necessary for its recital each day, and he therefore was personified
by the high priest of each temple in which the Ritual
was performed. The object of the Ritual was to place the
king in direct contact with his god Amen-R&#257; once a day.
The king was an incarnation of Amen-R&#257;, and ruled Egypt
as the representative upon earth of the god. He drew his
power and wisdom direct from the god, and it was believed
that these required renewal daily. To bring about this
renewal of the divine spirit in the god's vicegerent upon
earth, the king entered the temple in the early morning,
and performed ceremonies and recited formul&aelig; that purified
both the <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'sactuary'.">sanctuary</ins> and himself. He then advanced to
the shrine, which contained a small gilded wooden figure of
the god, inlaid with precious stones and provided with a
movable head, arms, and legs, and opened it and knelt down
before the figure. He performed further ceremonies of purification,
and finally took the figure of the god in his arms
and embraced it. During this embrace the divine power
of Amen-R&#257;, which was in the gilded figure at that moment,
passed into the body of the king, and the divine power and
wisdom, which were in the king as the god's representative,
were renewed. The king then closed the doors of the shrine
and left the sanctuary for a short time. When he returned
he opened the shrine again, and made adoration to the god,
and presented a series of offerings that symbolised Truth.
After this the king dressed the figure of the god in sacred
apparel, and decorated it. Then, having performed further
acts of worship before it, he closed the doors of the shrine,
sealed them with mud seals, and left the sanctuary.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_250" id="Pg_250" title="Pg_250">[250]</a></span>
<b>VI.</b> The <span class="smcap">Book "<b>May my Name Flourish</b>"</span>.&mdash;This was a
very popular funerary work in the Roman Period. It is a
development of a long prayer that is found in the Pyramid
Texts, and was written by the priests and used as a spell to
make the name of the deceased flourish eternally in heaven
and on the earth. Many copies of it, written on narrow strips
of papyrus, are preserved in the British Museum.<br /><br /></p>

<p><b>VII.</b> The <span class="smcap"><b>Book of &#256;apep</b></span>, the great enemy of the Sun-god.&mdash;&#256;apep
was the god of evil, who became incarnate in
many forms, especially in wild and savage animals and in
monster serpents and venomous reptiles of every kind. He
was supposed to take the form of a huge serpent and to lie
in wait near the portals of the dawn daily, so that he might
swallow up the sun as he was about to rise in the eastern
sky. He was accompanied by legions of devils and fiends,
red and black, and by all the powers of storm, tempest,
hurricane, whirlwind, thunder and lightning, and he was
the deadly foe of all order, both physical and moral, and of
all good in heaven and in earth. At certain times during
the day and night the priests in the temple of Amen-R&#257;
recited a series of chapters, and performed a number of
magical ceremonies, which were intended to strengthen
the arms of the Sun-god, and give him power to overcome
the resistance of &#256;apep. These chapters acted on &#256;apep
as spells, and they paralysed the monster just as he was about
to attack the Sun-god. The god then approached and shot
his fiery darts into him, and his attendant gods hacked the
monster's body to pieces, which shrivelled up under the
burning heat of the rays of the Sun-god, and all the devils
and fiends of darkness fled shrieking in terror at their leader's
fate. The sun then rose on this world, and all the stars and
spirits of the morning and all the gods of heaven sang for
joy. The complete text of this book is found in a long
papyrus dated in the reign of Alexander II in the British
Museum (No. 10,188).<br /><br /></p>

<p><b>VIII.</b> <span class="smcap"><b>The Instructions, or Precepts of Tuauf</b></span> to his son
Pepi.&mdash;Two copies of this work, which has also been called
a "Hymn in praise of learning," are contained in a papyri
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_251" id="Pg_251" title="Pg_251">[251]</a></span>preserved in the British Museum (Sallier II and Anastasi
VII). These "Instructions" in reality represent the advice
of a father to his son, whom he was sending to school to be
trained for the profession of the scribe. Whether the boy
was merely sorry to leave his home, or whether he disliked
the profession which his father had chosen for him, is not
clear, but from first to last the father urges him to apply
himself to the pursuit of learning, which, in his opinion,
is the foundation of all great and lasting success. He says,
"I have compared the people who are artisans and handicraftsmen
[with the scribe], and indeed I am convinced that
there is nothing superior to letters. Plunge into the study
of Egyptian Learning, as thou wouldst plunge into the river,
and thou wilt find that this is so. I would that thou wouldst
love Learning as thou lovest thy mother. I wish I were able
to make thee to see how beautiful Learning is. It is more
important than any trade in the world. Learning is not a
mere phrase, for the man who devoteth himself thereto from
his youth is honoured, and he is despatched on missions. I
have watched the blacksmith at the door of his furnace.
His hands are like crocodiles' hide, and he stinketh worse than
fishes' eggs. The metal worker hath no more rest than the
peasant on the farm. The stone mason&mdash;at the end of the
day his arms are powerless; he sitteth huddled up together
until the morning, and his knees and back are broken. The
barber shaveth until far into the night, he only resteth when
he eateth. He goeth from one street to another looking for
work. He breaketh his arms to fill his belly, and, like the
bees, he eateth his own labour. The builder of houses doeth
his work with difficulty; he is exposed to all weathers, and
he must cling to the walls which he is building like a creeping
plant. His clothes are in a horrible state, and he washeth
his body only once a day. The farmer weareth always the
same clothes. His voice is like the croak of a bird, his skin
is cracked by the wind; if he is healthy his health is that of
the beasts. If he be ill he lieth down among them, and he
sleepeth on the damp irrigated land. The envoy to foreign
lands bequeatheth his property to his children before he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_252" id="Pg_252" title="Pg_252">[252]</a></span>setteth out, being afraid that he will be killed either by wild
beasts of the desert or by the nomads therein. When he is
in Egypt, what then? No sooner hath he arrived at home
than he is sent off on another mission. As for the dyer, his
fingers stink like rotten fish, and his clothes are absolutely
horrors. The shoemaker is a miserable wretch. He is
always asking for work, and his health is that of a dying fish.
The washerman is neighbour to the crocodile. His food is
mixed up with his clothes, and every member of him is
unclean. The catcher of water-fowl, even though he dive
in the Nile, may catch nothing. The trade of the fisherman
is the worst of all. He is in blind terror of the crocodile,
and falleth among crocodiles." The text continues with a
few further remarks on the honourable character of the profession
of the scribe, and ends with a series of Precepts of
the same character as those found in the works of Ptah-hetep
and the scribe Ani, from which extracts have already been
given.<br /><br /></p>

<p><b>IX.</b> <span class="smcap"><b>Medical Papyri</b></span>.&mdash;The Egyptians possessed a good
practical knowledge of the anatomy of certain parts of the
human body, but there is no evidence that they practised
dissection before the arrival of the Greeks in Egypt. The
medical papyri that have come down to us contain a large
number of short, rough-and-ready descriptions of certain
diseases, and prescriptions of very great interest. The
most important medical papyrus known is that which was
bought at Luxor by the late Professor Ebers in 1872-3, and
which is now preserved in Leipzig. This papyrus is about
65 feet long, and the text is written in the hieratic character.
It was written in the ninth year of the reign of a king who
is not yet satisfactorily identified, but who probably lived
before the period of the rule of the eighteenth dynasty,
perhaps about 1800 B.C. A short papyrus in the British
Museum contains extracts from it, and other papyri with
somewhat similar contents are preserved in the Museums of
Paris, Leyden, Berlin, and California.<br /><br /></p>

<p><b>X.</b> <span class="smcap"><b>Magical Papyri</b></span>.&mdash;The widespread use of magic in
Egypt in all ages suggests that the magical literature of Egypt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_253" id="Pg_253" title="Pg_253">[253]</a></span>must have been very large. Much of it was incorporated
at a very early period into the Religious Literature of the
country, and was used for legitimate purposes, in fact for the
working of what we call "white magic." The Egyptian
saw no wrong in the working of magic, and it was only condemned
by him when the magician wished to produce evil
results. The gods themselves were supposed to use spells
and incantations, and every traveller by land or water carried
with him magical formul&aelig; which he recited when he was in
danger from the wild beasts of the desert or the crocodile
of the river and its canals. Specimens of these will be found
in the famous magical papyri in the British Museum, <i>e.g.</i> the
Salt Papyrus, the Rhind Papyrus, and the Harris Papyrus.
Under this heading may be mentioned Papyrus Sallier IV
in the British Museum, which contains a list of lucky and
unlucky days. Here is a specimen of its contents:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1st day of Hathor. The whole day is lucky. There is
festival in heaven with R&#257; and Hathor.</p>

<p>2nd day of Hathor. The whole day is lucky. The gods
go out. The goddess Uatchet comes from Tep to the gods
who are in the shrine of the bull, in order to protect the
divine members.</p>

<p>3rd day of Hathor. The whole day is lucky.</p>

<p>4th day of Hathor. The whole day is unlucky. The house
of the man who goes on a voyage on that day comes to ruin.</p>

<p>6th day of Hathor. The whole day is unlucky. Do not
light a fire in thy house on this day, and do not look at one.</p>

<p>18th day of Pharmuthi. The whole day is unlucky. Do
not bathe on this day.</p>

<p>20th day of Pharmuthi. The whole day is unlucky. Do
not work on this day.</p>

<p>22nd day of Pharmuthi. The whole day is unlucky. He
who is born on this day will die on this day.</p>

<p>23rd day of Pharmuthi. The first two-thirds of the day
are unlucky, and the last third lucky.</p><br /></div>

<p><b>XI.</b> <span class="smcap"><b>Legal Documents</b></span>.&mdash;The first legal document written
in Egypt was the will of R&#257;, in which he bequeathed all his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_254" id="Pg_254" title="Pg_254">[254]</a></span>property and the inheritance of the throne of Egypt to his
first-born son Horus. Tradition asserted that this Will was
preserved in the Library of the Sun-god in Heliopolis. The
inscriptions contain many allusions to the Laws of Egypt,
but no document containing any connected statement of
them has come down to us. In the great inscription of
Heruemheb, the last king of the eighteenth dynasty, a large
number of good laws are given, but it must be confessed that
as a whole the administration of the Law in many parts of
Egypt must always have been very lax. Texts relating to
bequests, endowments, grants of land, &amp;c., are very difficult
to translate, because it is well-nigh impossible to find equivalents
for Egyptian legal terms. In the British Museum are
two documents in hieratic that were drawn up in connection
with prosecutions which the Government of Egypt undertook
of certain thieves who had broken into some of the royal
tombs at Thebes and robbed them, and of certain other
thieves who had robbed the royal treasury and made away
with a large amount of silver (Nos. 10,221, 10,052, 10,053,
and 10,054). Equally interesting is the roll that describes
the prosecution of certain highly placed officials and relations
of Rameses III who had conspired against him and wanted
to kill him. Several of the conspirators were compelled to
commit suicide. The text is written in hieratic on papyrus,
and is preserved in the Royal Museum, Leyden.<br /><br /></p>

<p><b>XII.</b> <span class="smcap"><b>Historical Romances</b></span>.&mdash;Examples of these are the
narrative of the capture of the town of Joppa in Palestine
by an officer of Thothmes III, and the history of the dispute
that broke out between Seqenenr&#257;, King of Upper Egypt,
and &#256;apepi, King of Avaris in the Delta. These are written
in hieratic and are preserved in the British Museum, in
Harris Papyrus 500, and Sallier No. 1 (10,185).<br /><br /></p>

<p><b>XIII.</b> <span class="smcap"><b>Mathematics</b></span>.&mdash;The chief source of our knowledge
of the Mathematics of the Egyptians is the Rhind Papyrus
in the British Museum (No. 10,057), which was written before
1700 B.C., probably during the reign of one of the Hyksos
kings. The papyrus contains a number of simple arithmetical
examples and several geometrical problems. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_255" id="Pg_255" title="Pg_255">[255]</a></span>workings out of these prove that the Egyptian spared himself
no trouble in making his calculations, and that he worked
out both his arithmetical examples and problems in the most
cumbrous and laborious way possible. He never studied
mathematics in order to make progress in his knowledge of
the science, but simply for purely practical everyday work;
as long as his knowledge enabled him to obtain results which
he knew from experience were substantially correct he was
content.<br /></p>

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
